# A Neuro-Symbolic Multi-Agent Framework for Pre-Release Audience Response Generation in Bangla Cinema
### A Verifier-in-the-Loop Approach

**Status (2026-08-23):** the Bangla experiment and post-run analysis are
complete. The 5,400-generation surface is frozen; three-annotator human
evaluation is complete; seven thesis chapters and all 14 planned tables are
drafted. Remaining figures and institutional template fields remain. Review
split: G 300 / R1 2,162 / R2 2,163;
the separately registered 200-row development subset is drawn from within R1.

**Read `docs/STATUS.md` first.** It is the single source of truth for progress,
verified facts, and open decisions. This file states the contract; STATUS states
the state.

### The one finding you need before reading anything else
The 5,000-row corpus is **two corpora**, joined at raw row 1999 and differing
sharply in register. LaBSE K-Means on the full corpus identifies **which of the
two a review came from with 93.3% accuracy** — far more strongly than it tracks
sentiment (ARI 0.4813 vs 0.1793). So `region` is a controlled factor throughout,
axis analysis happens inside the organic region only, and no claim survives
that does not survive within-region. The resulting two-way cut is treated as a
human-recognizable cut through a continuum, not as discovered personas.
Provenance is unrecoverable: no collection
log exists and the collector does not remember. See
`results/s2c_region_split.md` and `results/s2_pilot_ari_trapcheck.md`.

## Reproducibility contract
- **Global seed = 42** (`src/common/seed.py`, used everywhere).
- **One config = one YAML = one result file.** Nothing hand-run in a notebook enters the paper.
- Every file in `results/` carries a timestamp and the git commit hash it was produced from.
- `data/raw/` is **read-only**. No script may write to it.
- `data/splits/split_map_v1.json` is frozen after creation and never regenerated.
- **The source `.xlsx` is pinned by checksum.** Every `review_id` derives from its
  raw row order, so a different copy silently invalidates every ID with no error.
  Verify byte-identity before any re-run:
  ```
  SHA-256  8f972734fc3629427cdf8d01716aa817f7b325410b2fdd0f26cbc2e68506db9f
  size     195,186 bytes
  ```
  Keep the exact workbook in a checksum-verified external backup. A fresh
  download is usable only if its hash matches; availability at Mendeley is
  not a backup guarantee. The cleaned CSV can be regenerated, but restoring
  its verified copy avoids rewriting the historical S1 result.

## Layout
```
data/      raw/ (immutable)  cleaned/ (gitignored)  splits/ (FROZEN)  plots/ (FROZEN)
src/       common/ preprocess/ cluster/ verifier/ agents/ eval/ demo/
configs/   one YAML per experiment
results/   auto-logged, never hand-edited — indexed in docs/STATUS.md
docs/      STATUS (read first), protocol (pre-registrations + deviations),
           lab_notebook (dated reasoning), dataset_card, research_pipeline (spec)
tests/     executable guards for splits, isolation, configs, scoring and demo
notebooks/ Kaggle/Colab runners ONLY (clone + install + call a script)
```

## Setup
For an existing study checkout, start with [the restoration guide](docs/RESTORE.md).
Cloning alone does not restore ignored data, trained Verifier-B or model caches.
The commands below describe a deliberate **new environment**, not restoration
of the historical experiment. Do not overwrite historical environment evidence
while setting up a new machine.

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.in        # resolves to latest
python src/common/env_snapshot.py     # writes requirements.lock.txt + results/env_*.json
```
Commit `requirements.lock.txt`. From then on, reruns use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.lock.txt
```

### Enable the pre-commit hook (once per clone)
```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
Git does not track hook configuration, so this is **not** inherited when you
clone — every working copy must run it once, or the check silently never runs.

`.githooks/pre-commit` runs `python src/common/step_close.py --check` and blocks
the commit on a non-zero exit. It enforces the Definition of Done in
`CLAUDE.md`: no unfilled TODOs in `docs/lab_notebook.md`, and no commit that
touches `results/` without touching the lab notebook alongside it.

To bypass deliberately — for example while `docs/protocol.md` is legitimately
still unfrozen before S2:
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
`--no-verify` is the intended override. Weakening the check itself to make a
commit pass is not.

**The hook must be mode `100755` in the index.** This checkout has
`core.fileMode=false`, so a plain `git add .githooks/pre-commit` can silently
drop the executable bit back to `100644`. Git then **skips the hook without any
warning** — the check looks enabled while never running. Verify and repair:
```bash
git ls-files -s .githooks/pre-commit      # must start with 100755
git update-index --chmod=+x .githooks/pre-commit   # fix if it reads 100644
```
`.gitattributes` pins **everything** to LF endings. `core.autocrlf` is **unset**
here (an earlier version of this file claimed otherwise, which was never true),
so CRLF written by Python on Windows shows up as a real diff: three result files
once appeared as a 279-line change with zero changed content. CRLF in a
`#!/bin/sh` script also breaks the hook on Linux/macOS, silently.

## Data availability
Base corpus: Raw Bangla Movie Review Comment Dataset (Mendeley), 5,000 rows.
See `docs/dataset_card.md` for provenance and the honest note on pre-cleaning.
