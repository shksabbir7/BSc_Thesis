# Full Research Pipeline — From Raw 5k Dataset to Complete Thesis (v7 — English Edition)
## Title: *A Neuro-Symbolic Multi-Agent Framework for Pre-Release Audience Response Generation in Bangla Cinema: A Verifier-in-the-Loop Approach*

**Starting assets:** ~5,000 raw Bangla movie reviews (Mendeley) + the locked title. No code, no labels.
**Core claim (one sentence):** In the completed Bangla arm, an external
task-trained verifier embedded in a generate–verify–refine loop improves control
of a human-recognizable engagement-specificity axis relative to zero-shot
generation, while an independent held-out verifier exposes proxy divergence;
the thesis scope is Bangla cinema response generation.

> **SCOPE AMENDMENT — 2026-08-23, Sabbir's explicit decision.** The submitted
> thesis contains four research questions. The former cross-language RQ is
> removed from the thesis scope, and the verifier-divergence question is
> renumbered RQ4. Historical English-arm design sections below are retained only
> as an audit trail; they are not a thesis contribution, result, limitation or
> future-work commitment. This amendment supersedes their active status.

**Timeline:** ~14 weeks | **Compute:** free Colab/Kaggle GPU | **API cost:** ~~৳0 (Groq free tier primary; Gemini free tier secondary)~~ **৳0 — generation local on Kaggle T4 as of 2026-08-12 (§4.4 box); Gemini secondary unchanged**
~~**This file is the English mirror of `research_pipeline_bn.md` (v7). Both are normative; if they ever disagree, fix both.**~~

✅ **STRUCK 2026-08-11 — Sabbir's ruling (decision 18, option b): "bangla ar english to same e. dorkar ki bangla alada kore likhar."** `research_pipeline_bn.md` never existed, and it will not be written. **THIS FILE IS THE ONLY NORMATIVE PIPELINE.** Bangla stays in use for explanation and teaching — per Sabbir's standing request — but no Bangla document is normative, so there is no second file to keep in sync and no second file to go stale.

---

> ## 🔧 MAINTENANCE STATE — corrected 2026-08-11
>
> **This file had not been touched since 2026-08-01 — 55 commits.** Sabbir asked
> why the pipeline was not being maintained, and the answer is that it was not:
> progress was being written to `docs/STATUS.md` only, on the assumption that one
> "where are we" file was enough. It is not. **STATUS says where we are; this file
> says what we are supposed to do, and CLAUDE.md gives *this* file precedence on
> method.** A normative document that is the stalest document in the repo cannot
> perform that job, and anyone opening it cold — a supervisor, a reviewer, a
> future reader — would have seen a plan that died a week earlier.
>
> **Fixed in this pass:** the execution checklist below (8 steps were complete and
> unticked), the §5.1 generation count, and the persona-count arithmetic in the S6
> contract and §4.5.
>
> ---
>
> ### 🔧 SECOND PASS — 2026-08-11, later the same day, at the start of Phase 4
>
> **The first pass missed four live survivals of text it had already struck.**
> Decision 19 struck *"first-pass 60–70%"* and decision 17 struck the uniform
> τ grid, and both strikes were applied **to the §4.5 argument box and nowhere
> else**. Still reading as live instructions afterwards:
>
> | Where | What survived |
> |---|---|
> | checklist step 16 (line ~148) | the struck **`0.6×VerifierA + 0.4×symbolic`** |
> | checklist step 17 (line ~149) | *"first-pass 60–70%"*, **plus** *"blocked by open decision 17"* — closed — **plus its refuted premise** (*"79 of 82 dev items sit at confidence 0.998"*) |
> | S5 stage contract, Gate **G4** (line ~199) | *"if first-attempt pass rate doesn't reach 60–70%, raise τ"* |
> | §4.5 bullet list (line ~473) | *"Pick the operating point where first-attempt pass ≈ 60–70%"* — **four lines below the box that strikes it** |
>
> All four are now struck in place, not deleted, and each points at the section
> of `protocol.md` that replaced it.
>
> 🔑 **The lesson, recorded because it is now three-for-three.** `0.6/0.4`
> survived after its derivation was found not to exist; line 8's Bangla mirror
> survived because nobody followed the reference; and these four survived
> because a strike was written into the prose and not into the instructions.
> **Every one is a case where corrected and uncorrected text lived in the same
> file and only one copy was edited.** Striking a number now means grepping the
> whole file for it, not editing the paragraph where the argument happens to
> live — a reader scanning a checklist or a gate table never reaches the box.
>
> **Deliberately NOT fixed, because it is not Claude's to fix:** every occurrence
> of *persona* / *three personas* as **framing language** (§2.3 heading, §8.1,
> §8.2, the Ch.1 blueprint). That is **open decision 12 — Sabbir's wording call.**
> Each is flagged inline with 🔴 **[D12]** rather than silently rewritten. The
> *constraint* is already fixed and is not optional: K = 2, and the words
> *persona* and *cluster* are both retired in favour of **axis / gradient / the
> cut / level** (STATUS decision 12, 2026-08-10). Only the replacement wording is
> open.
>
> ⛔ **CORRECTION TO THIS BOX, same day, before Sabbir acted on it.** The first
> version said *"`research_pipeline_bn.md` has NOT received this pass"* and called
> the mirrors out of sync. **That was wrong, and wrong in the way this project
> keeps warning about: it was written from line 8 rather than from the disk.**
> `research_pipeline_bn.md` does not exist and never has -- not in `docs/`, not in
> the repo, not in git history. Line 8 asserted a second normative document that
> was never written, and it survived since v7 because **nobody ever tried to
> follow the reference.**
>
> ✅ **RESOLVED the same day. Sabbir's ruling: no Bangla mirror will be written**
> ("bangla ar english to same e"). Line 8 is struck; this file is the sole
> normative pipeline. Bangla remains the language of explanation, not of record.
> STATUS decision 18 is closed.

## 📊 S0 — X-ray of the actual data file (ground truth for everything below)

> ## ⛔ CORRECTED 2026-08-01 — read this before the table
>
> **This section was written from claims, not measurements. Three of its numbers
> were wrong and one of its premises was wrong.** Corrections are inline below,
> struck through rather than deleted, so the original can still be audited.
>
> **The premise that failed:** this table treats the 5,000 rows as one corpus.
> **They are two.** Rows 0–1998 and 1999–4999 differ on features that carry no
> sentiment content — দাঁড়ি 38.7% vs 99.2%, first-person pronouns 13.5% vs 0.8%,
> lexical richness 255 vs 128 types per 1,000 tokens — with a step transition at
> one row, not a drift. All 1,670 class-2 rows sit in the second region.
> Evidence: `results/s2c_region_split.md`.
>
> **The consequence, measured:** LaBSE K-Means on the full corpus identifies
> **which of the two corpora a review came from with 93.3% accuracy**
> (ARI(cluster, region) = 0.4813 against ARI(cluster, Sentiment) = 0.1793;
> binary recast ARI 0.7487, φ 0.861). The clusters this pipeline calls "personas"
> are, on the full corpus, **a corpus detector**. See
> `results/s2_pilot_ari_trapcheck.md`.
>
> **What this changes in the design, and it is not cosmetic:**
> - `region` is a **controlled factor** throughout. The split stratifies on
>   `Sentiment × region`, every headline metric is reported full / A / B, and no
>   claim survives that does not survive within-region.
>   (`docs/protocol.md`, "Scope decision".)
> - **Persona discovery happens inside region A**, never on the full corpus.
> - **Gold-300 must be stratified on the region-A clustering.** Stratifying on
>   the full-corpus clustering would stratify 300 annotations on a file seam.
> - Provenance is **unrecoverable**: no venue, thread or timestamp column, no
>   collection log, and the collector does not remember. Closed as unresolvable
>   2026-07-30; both the measurement and his account are recorded, unreconciled.

**File:** `Raw_Bangla_Movie_Review_Comment_Dataset...xlsx` → 1 sheet, **5,000 rows × 2 columns: `Movie Review`, `Sentiment`**

| Finding | Number | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Sentiment labels (0/1/2) | 1,665 / 1,664 / 1,670 — ~~perfectly balanced~~ **balanced in the raw file only; 1,513 / 1,599 / 1,618 after cleaning** | 🎁 Free external-validity metadata (§2.4); the balance is curated — disclose in the dataset card. **No prevalence claim may be made: stopping was quota-driven.** |
| **Movie-title column** | **Absent**; in-text name mentions are rare (শাকিব=18, শাবানা=17) | ❌ A held-out-films split is impossible → split map and §5.4 redesigned accordingly |
| Exact/normalized duplicates | 204 / ~~205~~ **206** | Removed in cleaning |
| Reviews with <3 words | 72 | Removed |
| Null rows | ~~1~~ **2** — one missing text, one missing label | Removed |
| **Usable n** | ~~**≈ 4,722**~~ **4,730** after rule-based cleaning; **4,625** after near-duplicate removal at the pre-registered t = 0.95 | All split sizes derive from this. 4,722 came from subtracting the three drop sets as if disjoint, double-counting the 10 rows in SHORT ∩ DUP. Verified in `results/s0_data_xray.md`. |
| **Corpus composition** | **Two corpora, joined at raw row 1999**: 1,999 organic + 3,001 uniform-register | **NOT in the original table.** Region A survives cleaning as 1,910 rows / 2 classes; region B as 2,820 / 3 classes. See the correction box above. |
| Word count | median **8**, mean 9.6, max 84; only 12 reviews ≥50 words | Very short reviews — generated text must match this length distribution (JS-on-length matters); verifier max_len=64 suffices |
| Emoji | **0 rows** | ❌ Emoji features are dead → symbolic scorer is text-only (§3.5); the pre-defence emoji preprocessing tables do not match this file — fix in the thesis |
| URLs/mentions | 0 | The file is partially pre-cleaned despite the "Raw" name — state this honestly in the dataset card |
| Intensifiers present? | খুব=775, অসাধারণ=283, ভালো=643, বাজে=88, ফালতু=65 | ✅ Text-only symbolic features are viable |
| Sentiment × length | positive(1)=11.9 words vs 8.2/8.8 | ✅ First external-validity signal already visible |

**⚠️ New scientific risk:** with 8-word reviews, the easiest thing for LaBSE clustering to capture is sentiment itself — the "3 personas" could be a rediscovery of the 3 sentiment classes. Hence a **mandatory trap-check (§2.4): ARI(cluster labels, Sentiment)**. If >0.6, either re-operationalize personas with engagement features (length/intensity/specificity) or honestly present them as "sentiment-anchored engagement tiers." Hiding it is forbidden; the result is reported either way.

> ✅ **ANSWERED 2026-07-31 (step 10), and the risk was real but not the one feared.**
> ARI(cluster, Sentiment) = **0.1793** on the full corpus — well under 0.6, so the
> clusters are *not* a sentiment rediscovery. **But ARI(cluster, region) = 0.4813**:
> they were detecting which of the two corpora a review came from. The trap-check
> caught a trap the pipeline had not anticipated, which is the argument for running
> checks whose outcome you think you can predict.

## 🚀 START HERE — Step-by-step execution order (complete each ☐ before the next)

> **Tick discipline (added 2026-08-11).** ☑ means *the result file exists and its
> lab-notebook entry is written*. ⚠️ means partly done, with the gap named. ✗ means
> **established as not producible** — those are not pending work and must stop
> being read as pending. Every ☑ below names the file that justifies it, so the
> tick can be checked rather than trusted.

**Week 1 — Foundations**
☑ 1. Create the repo (§0.1 layout), requirements.txt, global seed=42 — `src/common/seed.py`, `requirements.lock.txt`
☑ 2. Draft `protocol.md` (§0.2) — written and running; **53 rows in its Deviations log.** ✅ **supervisor sign-off OBTAINED** — Sabbir, 2026-08-11. `docs/supervisor_seal_packet.md` (prepared 2026-08-10, Phases 1–3) was signed; the signed copy is not held in the repo at Sabbir's instruction, so it is recorded as a student report rather than a repo artifact. **Week 1 is now fully closed.** Phases 4–6 seal separately
☑ 3. Core base papers (§0.3) — superseded in practice by `docs/related_work.md` (9 tiers) and the CLAUDE.md search-first rule, which is stricter than "read these first"

**Weeks 2–3 — Data (S1)**
☑ 4. xlsx → clean → `bn_clean.csv` — **n = 4,730**, not 4,722 (see corrected S0) [§1.1] — `results/s0_data_xray.md`, `results/s1_cleaning_log.json`
☑ 5. Freeze the split file — **FROZEN 2026-08-01**, `data/splits/split_map_v1.json`, committed. **G 300 / R1 2,162 / R2 2,163 = 4,625** after near-dup removal at t = 0.95; `dev` = 200 is a **subset of R1**, not a fourth partition. Stratified on `Sentiment × region` as required. Never regenerated
☑ 6. Bangla plots — **120 = 30 dev + 90 eval**, harvested from bn.wikipedia and FROZEN 2026-07-31. Not 130: the source does not hold 130 Bangla films with usable plot sections, and both routes to 130 were refused (deviation logged) [§1.1.7]
☐ 7. English arm: IMDB subsample **matched to the Bangla n actually used** (4,730, or 1,910 if the arm mirrors region A) + MPST plots **30+90** + tokenizer-fertility table [§1.2] — ✅ **SCHEDULED, not cut** (Sabbir 2026-08-11): full §1.2 charter runs after the Bangla machinery exists, since every config takes the corpus as a field. RQ4 stays live in its strong form

**Weeks 3–5 — The engagement-specificity axis (S2–S3)** 🔴 **[D12]** *section title still says "Personas" in the bn mirror*
☑ 8. LaBSE embed → master K-table (7 criteria, K=2..8) [§2.1–2.2] — `results/s2d_ktable_regionA.md`, `s2d_ktable_regionB.md`. 🔴 **Outcome: K = 2, not 3** — K=3's prediction strength was 0.669 against a cutoff of 0.80 fixed two days earlier (decision 7, closed 2026-08-03)
☑ 9. GMM-BIC + HDBSCAN + multi-encoder ARI [§2.2] — 🔴 **Outcome: there is no cluster structure.** Silhouette **0.053**, gap statistic monotone, **HDBSCAN labels 100% noise**. Region B additionally cleared PS at **0.818** on a cut correlating with nothing measurable → kept as a **negative control** (RQ1-G). *Stability is not validity*
☑ 10. **ARI(cluster, Sentiment) trap-check** [§2.4] — DONE. Full corpus 0.1793 but ARI(cluster, **region**) 0.4813 → the clusters are a corpus detector. Region A alone: 0.1804, Band 1, not degenerate. **Also score every future clustering against `region`.**
☑ 11. Gate G1 → profiling [§2.3–2.4] — `results/s2e_*`, `s2f_*`. ⚠️ **G1 FAILED in the informative direction** (see step 9), and 🔴 **all S2e/S2f inferential statistics were DEMOTED to descriptive on 2026-08-10**: φ = 0.3981 and χ² = 300.7 are post-clustering inference on the very rows that defined the partition (Chen & Witten 2023). **No p-value here is evidence that the halves differ**
☑ 12. G-300 → annotation → Gate G2 [§2.5] — ⚠️ **round 1 FAILED** (ordinal α = 0.4970, rating scale). **Attempt 2 used comparative judgement and worked** — this is CLAUDE.md's search-first entry #1 (Kiritchenko & Mohammad, ACL 2017, had already shown rating scales less reliable). 🎁 **RQ1-H is the single non-circular result in the thesis: 0.78 / 0.84 against 0.25 chance, length-matched, length heuristic below chance**

**Weeks 5–7 — Verifiers (S4)**
☑ 13. Backbone ablation (4 models × gold-300) [§3.2] — done, **then repurposed.** 🔴 `results/s3b_baselines.md` verdict = **`CIRCULARITY_CONFIRMED`**: a frozen linear probe on the encoder that *generated* the label matches the best fine-tuned arm to within one dev item (0.9866 vs 0.9647). **The table may support NO claim about backbones**; it is reported as a demonstration that the label is linearly recoverable. "Pick the winner" is void as written
⚠️ 14. Train Verifier-A + B (bn, en) → dual accuracy [§3.1, 3.3] → Gate G3 — **bn pair DONE 2026-08-11** (`results/s3c_verifier_a.json`, `s3d_verifier_b.json`): A 0.986555 (1 error in 82, reproduces S3.2b), B `COMPETENT_EVALUATOR` 0.959666, mean 0.967442 ± 0.015839 over 5 seeds. **en pair not built** (step 7). ✗ **the dual-accuracy table is NOT PRODUCIBLE** — established 2026-08-08. 🔴 **Pre-committed: no claim that either verifier is better may be made from dev-82** (1 item = 0.0122 macro-F1)
☑ 15. Calibration (ECE + temperature scaling) [§3.4] + LR-learned symbolic rules [§3.5] — **both done 2026-08-11.** 🔴 **Verifier-A was miscalibrated: ECE 0.11836 → 0.00537**, and the direction is **UNDER-confidence** (T = 0.10918 < 1), opposite to `guo2017calibration`'s finding. ✅ **Verifier-B's pre-committed null FIRED** (ΔECE CI [−0.00661, +0.00705] straddles zero). ⚠️ Symbolic scorer is weak and gameable: CV **0.5150 ± 0.0713** vs majority 0.3926, features almost all presence-based. 🔴 **F1/IDF disabled pending Sabbir's rule-7 ruling — measured cost ~18 macro-F1 points**

**Weeks 7–9 — Loop (S5)** — ✅ **COMPLETE 2026-08-20.** Phase 4 is where the title's *"Multi-Agent"* and *"Verifier-in-the-Loop"* live. S4.6 dynamics and the complete 8/8 failure census are reported; the 50-case and double-coding shortfalls are explicit deviations, not silently repaired.
☑ 16. Build LangGraph (§4.1–4.2) + generator pilot — **DONE, with a void model comparison recorded rather than repaired post hoc.** The four role-separated components, R1-only index, trace schema, local nf4 Writer, Reflector retries, and length-controlled dev-plot substrate are implemented and tested. The TigerLLM upload proved byte-identical to Gemma-3, so the comparison is void; Gemma-3-12b-it remains the bounded single generator. S4.5a then established no held-out predictive value for the symbolic mixture, so Verifier-A alone gates while symbolic rules remain diagnostic.
☑ 17. τ sweep → operating point [§4.5] → Gate G4 — **RUN 2026-08-20.** ~~first-pass 60–70%~~ remains struck: the registered gain-per-call argmax selects **τ*=0.4384071**, Verifier-B quality **0.802219**, mean **2.000 calls**, first-pass **0.6500**, final acceptance **0.8667**. alpha_lo **0.640501** at one call; explicit `FORCED_3` alpha_hi **0.866272** at five calls; selected fraction of achievable gain **71.63%**. The full observed-score frontier and mandatory per-level views are retained. **Global headline, not hierarchical pooling:** primary reading found the cited paper did not contain the registered variance-ratio estimator; that pre-run correction is recorded in `protocol.md` and STATUS.
☑ 18. Loop dynamics + failure taxonomy [§4.6] — **DONE 2026-08-20.** Non-monotone per-attempt A/symbolic/B curves, per-level retry rates, accepted-stop vs emitted-attempt distributions, frontier figure, and complete census of all **8** observed three-time gate failures. 🔴 Deviations: 8 not the impossible 50; Sabbir waived independent Coder-B after reviewing Coder-A, so the final taxonomy is explicitly single-coder/user-endorsed with `agreement=null`.

**Weeks 9–12 — Experiments (S6)**
☐ 19. Main run **10 conditions × 2 languages × 90 eval plots × 2 levels = 3,600 condition-cases** (1,800/language; multi-call rows logged separately) [§5.1] — all outcome scoring via Verifier-B
☐ 20. Goodhart figures [§5.3] + plot-level realism test [§5.4] + cross-lingual Δ table [§5.5] + mini-ablations [§5.1b]
☐ 21. Statistics: bootstrap CIs + BH correction + effect sizes, ≥3 seeds [§5.6]
☐ 22. Human eval: 100 generated items × 3 annotators [§5.2]

**Weeks 12–14 — Writing + compliance (Phases 6–7)**
☐ 23. Thesis chapters [§6.1] + Limitations organized by four validity types
☐ 24. Phase-7 checklist — all HARD items first
☐ 25. Demo + defence package [Phase 8]

## ⛔ FROZEN EXECUTION CONTRACT — code is merely the translation of this

### A. Data split map — done once on Day 1, seed=42, then untouchable

```
Raw 5,000 ──clean (drop dup 204 + short 72 + null 1)──► usable = 4,730 (4,625 after near-dup removal)
                                │
                ┌───────────────┴───────────────┐
                ▼                               ▼
          G: gold-300                     R: remaining ≈ 4,422
          (cluster-stratified,            ┌───────┴───────┐
          3 annotators, κ + α)            ▼               ▼

                                    + RAG index      (eval-only)
                                    + dev slice 200
```
**Where H went:** the file has no movie-title column and in-text mentions are rare → reviews cannot be mapped to films, so the "held-out films" split is removed. The held-out element for evaluation is now **120 externally collected plots** (§1.1.7: 30 dev + 90 eval, disjoint; harvested and frozen 2026-07-31) — these never need to map to any review.

**Inviolable rules:**
- **G never enters** training, the RAG index, prompts, or threshold tuning. Eval-only.
- **RAG index = R1 only.** R2 never appears in retrieval — otherwise Verifier-B is contaminated.
- **Verifier-B never enters the loop** — S6 scoring only. This wall *is* the Goodhart test.
- G's 300 need cluster labels for stratification, so G is finalized **after** S2 (placeholder at S1).
- The split file (review-ID lists) is the single most important artifact of the thesis; commit to git, never regenerate.

### B. Stage contracts S1–S6

| Stage | What gets trained | Input → Output | Gate (fail = next stage forbidden) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **S1** Data prep + split | nothing | xlsx 5,000 → clean **4,730** + IMDB subsample (matched n) + **120 bn plots (30/90)** + matched en plots → `bn_clean`, `en_clean`, frozen split file **stratified on `Sentiment × region`** | — |
| **S2** Persona discovery ⚠️ **on region A only** — on the full corpus the clusters are a corpus detector (93.3%) | K-Means (both languages) + GMM + HDBSCAN robustness | R + LaBSE → master K-table (7 criteria), stability, theory grounding, persona definitions | **G1:** prediction strength < 0.8 or bootstrap ARI worse than neighboring K → K=3 may not be forced; most stable K becomes primary, K=3 theory-motivated secondary |
| **S3** Human gold | nothing | **region-A-**stratified 300 → gold labels + Fleiss κ **and** Krippendorff's α (ordinal) | **G2:** α < 0.667 → revise guideline + re-annotate; failing twice → reframe claim ("theory-driven scheme, validated learnability") |
| **S4** Verifier training | **bn-A, bn-B, en-A, en-B** (4 classifiers) + symbolic-weight LR ×2 + temperature scaling ×4 | R1/R2 → dual accuracy (weak-label **and** gold), calibration (ECE before/after) | **G3:** gold accuracy < ~55% (chance=33%) → verifier too weak; increase symbolic weight / inspect data |
| **S5** Loop build + τ sweep | nothing (calibration only) | Verifier-A + R1-RAG → LangGraph loop, τ swept at **quantiles of the observed score distribution** (~~0.30–0.95 uniform~~ struck, decision 17) on dev-plots, operating point | **G4:** ~~if first-attempt pass rate doesn't reach 60–70%, raise τ~~ **STRUCK** (decision 19 — an unreachable target that could not be derived). Replaced: **τ\* = argmax [quality(τ) − α_lo] / E[calls](τ)**, both endpoints scored by **Verifier-B, never A**. The underlying worry survives and is kept: *"everything passes" means the loop is dead* — but it is now read off the frontier, not enforced by a target |
| **S6** Experiments | nothing (all inference) | **10 conditions** × 2 languages × **90 eval-plots** (disjoint from dev-30) × ~~3 personas~~ **2 axis levels** → master table, Goodhart figures, plot-level realism JS (§5.4) | All outcome scoring via **Verifier-B + human eval**; A stays inside the loop/row-9 selection only. ⚠️ **Verifier-B's calibration improvement is NOT established** (null fired 2026-08-11) — report that beside the Goodhart test, since B is the scorer here |

**Total trained artifacts: 10** (4 verifiers + 2 LR + 4 temperature scalings) — all small, all free-Colab. **No LLM is ever trained** — generation is prompted only.

### C. Finalized stack — all ৳0

| Layer | Tool | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Generator (primary) | ~~**Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct or Qwen2.5-7B @ Groq free tier**~~ ⛔ **CORRECTED 2026-08-12: local T4, `gemma-3-12b-it` vs `TigerLLM-9B-it` — see the §4.4 correction box** | Open-weight = reproducible; choose via a 20-generation Bangla pilot; version-pinned checkpoint goes in the paper |
| Generator (secondary) | Gemini 2.x Flash free tier ⚠️ still scheduled as the robustness subset; unaffected by the 2026-08-12 provider move | "Results hold across a proprietary model" robustness check |
| Orchestration | **LangGraph** (version pinned) | Explicit graph+state; CrewAI/AutoGen forbidden (over-abstraction, hard to log) |
| RAG | ChromaDB + LaBSE | Index = R1 only |
| Verifiers | `csebuetnlp/banglabert` (110M) / `distilroberta-base` (82M) | Deliberately small — the claim *is* "cheap verifier"; a large English model would poison the cross-lingual comparison |
| Eval | `mauve-text`, sklearn, scipy, nltk, statsmodels, `netcal` | MAUVE = comparable with MoP |
| Annotation | **Label Studio** (local, free) | Randomization + progress tracking |
| Tracking / Writing | W&B free / CSV + Overleaf free + public GitHub | Code-availability statements are mandatory at many Q1 journals |

**Three reviewer-proof habits:** (1) pin every version + checkpoint names in the appendix; (2) one config = one YAML = one result file — nothing hand-run in a notebook enters the paper; (3) API sampling is stochastic — the answer is 100 plots per condition × bootstrap CIs, plus one line in Limitations.

## PHASE 1 — Data Engineering: Bangla + English Mirror (Weeks 2–3)

### 1.1 Bangla side (primary)
1. **Start from the raw 5k. Do not use the augmented 9,998** for clustering/training — augmentation creates semantic duplicates that artificially harden cluster structure. If used at all: as a separate disclosed robustness check.
2. Cleaning (regex): strip URL/HTML/mentions/hashtag symbols; normalize whitespace.
3. **⚠️ Old pipeline's mistake, corrected: no stemming, no stopword removal.** LaBSE/BanglaBERT are contextual encoders and need natural text; stemming/stopwords belong to the TF-IDF era. Also delete the TF-IDF/Count-Vectorization sections from the thesis — unused anywhere.
4. Filter (**measured**, superseding the estimates): exact dup **204**, <3-word **72**, null **2** → **4,730** (the union is 270, not the 278 you get by subtracting the drop sets as if disjoint); near-duplicate removal at LaBSE cosine ≥ 0.95 removes a further **105** → **4,625**.
5. ~~Movie-title tagging~~ **(cancelled)** — no title column, rare in-text names → film mapping impossible. Replaced by the redesigned §5.4. State this limitation in the dataset card.
6. Emoji **(zero in the file)** — nothing to extract; symbolic scorer is text-only (§3.5). The file is partially pre-cleaned despite "Raw" — state honestly; fix the inconsistent pre-defence emoji tables.
7. **Plot collection (DONE 2026-07-31):** **120** Bangla plot synopses (3–12 sentences, median 9) — **30 dev-plots** (τ-sweep + pilot, §4.5) + **90 eval-plots** (S6 main run only), **disjoint**, else the threshold is tuned on eval data (leakage). Sources: Wikipedia (bn), bmdb.com.bd, self-written; log the source per plot. **Plot text never comes from the review corpus.**

### 1.2 English Arm Charter

> One-line constitution: **Mirror, never merge. One table, one paragraph, one week — cut anything beyond.**

**⛔ Mirror-not-merge (inviolable):** English data never enters Bangla training/clustering/RAG — no translate-train, no joint multilingual training, no cross-lingual augmentation. Doing so changes the research question ("does the verifier help in low-resource?" → "does transfer help?") — exactly the supervisor's scope complaint. Two fully independent, matched pipelines.

**Datasets:**
1. **Reviews (clustering + verifier training): IMDB Large Movie Review (Maas et al. 2011)** — HuggingFace `imdb`. Deliberate: **MoP also uses IMDB/SST-2**, so our English numbers are directly comparable with theirs — say so in the paper.
2. **Plots (generation input): MPST v2** (Kar et al., LREC 2018; ritual.uh.edu/mpst-2018) — sample **30 dev + 90 eval** synopses, matched to the Bangla side. IMDB has no plots; review corpus and plot corpus are from different sources — disclose (symmetric with Bangla).
3. Random subsample to n = |bn_clean| (seed=42), same cleaning, same split construction.

**Scope table (what the English arm does / does not do):**
| Does | Does NOT (Bangla-only) |
|---|---|
| LaBSE clustering + identical K-selection protocol | Plot-level realism test (§5.4 — bn primary; en optional if time allows) |
| Verifier en-A/en-B training + backbone check (§3.2) | Multi-encoder robustness check |
| Full 8-condition ablation (§5.1) | 300-item human gold (a 100-sample check, or an honest limitation — §2.5) |
| Tokenizer-fertility covariate | Separate theory grounding (same citations apply) |

**Framing rules (how the paper words it):**
- English = **reference ceiling**, not strict apples-to-apples. Never attribute the score gap purely to "language difficulty" — encoder/generator/tokenizer artifacts contribute (Petrov et al., NeurIPS 2023: identical text can tokenize up to 15× longer across languages; Rust et al. 2021). Report the fertility table beside every cross-lingual comparison.
- The core comparison is **Δ (improvement over zero-shot)** per condition, en-column vs bn-column (§5.5). Three outcomes → three honest claims: Δ_bn > Δ_en → "the verifier matters more in low-resource" (strongest); Δ_bn ≈ Δ_en → "the verifier helps generally; demonstrated in low-resource Bangla" (still publishable); English arm exceeding one week → cut to fertility + zero-shot reference only.
- Matched controls: n, domain, K, encoder (LaBSE both sides — zero encoder confound), generator LLM, hybrid weights, τ-selection procedure. Verifier backbones differ (BanglaBERT vs DistilRoBERTa) — an unavoidable confound; mitigate via the size-matched pairing of §3.2 and state in Limitations.

**English-side comparator papers (position against these):** MoP (formalism + IMDB/SST-2 + MAUVE/FID — the main baseline family); Sands et al. NCAA 2026 (their "emotional richness gap" is your motivation); WWW 2026 Companion (persona prompting can *degrade* survey alignment); "LLM Generated Persona is a Promise with a Catch" (NeurIPS 2025 Position).

**Fertility measurement (during S1):** tokens/word in both languages under the generator's tokenizer — one small table, reported as a covariate.

### 1.3 Dataset cards (both corpora)
Source, collection dates, per-step attrition, length distributions, license, the partial-pre-cleaning disclosure. *Base: Gebru et al., Datasheets for Datasets.*

**Deliverables:** `bn_clean.csv`, `en_clean.csv` (matched n), **120 bn + 120 en** plots, dataset cards, fertility table.

## PHASE 2 — Persona Discovery + Human Ground Truth (Weeks 3–5)

> 🎯 Goal: prove "personas are real, not clustering artifacts." This is where circularity is broken.
> ⚠️ **Core principle:** "why K=3?" is never answered by one elbow plot. The answer is a **four-layer convergence**: (1) multiple internal indices, (2) stability, (3) human validation, (4) theory. The paper sentence: *"K=3 was selected by convergence of multiple internal indices, confirmed by stability analysis (bootstrap ARI, prediction strength ≥ 0.8), corroborated across encoders (ARI/AMI), validated by human annotators (Krippendorff's α), and grounded in established audience-engagement typologies; GMM/BIC and HDBSCAN are reported as robustness checks."*

### 2.1 Embedding + clustering (same encoder both languages)
- **LaBSE**, 768-dim. Cluster in the **original space (or PCA-95% space)**, cosine distance.
- **UMAP is visualization-only** — never cluster in UMAP space (non-linear + stochastic; poisons validity claims). Caption: "visualization only."
- **K = 2…8 sweep.** One master table, 7 columns per K: Silhouette, Calinski–Harabasz, Davies–Bouldin, **Gap statistic** (Tibshirani et al. 2001, B=100), **bootstrap ARI (mean±SD)**, **Prediction strength** (Tibshirani & Walther 2005), **GMM-BIC**. This table *is* the primary answer to "why 3."
- Honesty clause: silhouette 0.05–0.15 is normal in high-dim transformer spaces (hubness, anisotropy, distance concentration). Write: "low silhouette reflects known pathologies of high-dimensional embedding spaces, not absence of structure; hence we rely on stability + human validation."

### 2.2 Stability + robustness (the real tribunal for K)
- **Bootstrap ARI:** 80% subsample × 100 runs → ARI vs full-data labels, mean±SD per K. The most stable K is the prime candidate.
- **Prediction strength:** rule — **the largest K with PS ≥ 0.8** (Tibshirani & Walther's own cutoff).
- **Alternative-method robustness:** **GMM+BIC** (soft membership — the honest model if personas overlap; report BIC-minimum K) and **HDBSCAN** (discovers K itself + allows noise; report its K and noise fraction; if it also finds ~3 groups, that is strong independent evidence).
- **Multi-encoder check (bn only):** LaBSE vs BanglaBERT mean-pooled vs multilingual-E5 → pairwise ARI/AMI.
- **If criteria disagree** (e.g., silhouette→2, gap→4): (1) report the full table — no cherry-picking; (2) **stability > compactness**; (3) human validation + theory are the tie-break, stated explicitly; (4) acknowledge the disagreement in Limitations.

### 2.3 Theory grounding — ~~"three personas"~~ did not fall from the sky

> 🔴 **[D12] WORDING IS SABBIR'S — 2026-08-11.** K = 2, not 3 (decision 7), and the
> words *persona* and *cluster* are both retired (decision 12): the literature
> reserves *cluster* for structure we do not have (silhouette 0.053, monotone gap,
> HDBSCAN 100% noise). Permitted: **axis, gradient, the cut, level**. The theory
> grounding below still matters — but it now grounds **a two-level engagement-
> specificity axis**, and the section must be rewritten to say so. Claude has not
> rewritten it, because the replacement wording is Sabbir's call.
The three tiers are a collapse of established engagement continua. Cite:
- **Abercrombie & Longhurst (1998), *Audiences*** — consumer → fan → cultist → enthusiast
- **Hunt, Bristol & Bashaw (1999), *J. Services Marketing* 13(6)** — five fan types (⚠️ often mis-attributed — verify authorship before citing)
- **Funk & James (2001), Psychological Continuum Model** — awareness → attraction → attachment → allegiance
- **Cuadrado & Frasquet (1999), *J. Cultural Economics* 23(4)** — empirical 3-cluster cinema segmentation: social 36.1% / apathetic 28.2% / cinema-buff 35.7% (p=0.000) — almost a mirror of our scheme
- Honesty: some studies find four segments — write "3 vs 4 is a modeling choice; theory-motivated, data-confirmed, human-validated."

### 2.4 Persona interpretation (linguistic profiling)
Per cluster: mean length, intensifier frequency (খুব/দারুণ/অসাধারণ), negation, actor/director mentions, top-20 distinctive terms (log-odds). This table yields each persona's **operational definition** (behavioral criteria, not just a name).
**External validity (strengthened — we have Sentiment):** cluster × Sentiment cross-tab + χ², and cluster × length. First signal already visible: positive reviews are longer (11.9 vs 8.2 words).
**⚠️ Mandatory trap-check:** **ARI(cluster labels, Sentiment)**. If >0.6, personas ≈ sentiment rediscovery → either engagement-feature re-operationalization, or the honest "sentiment-anchored engagement tiers" framing. Reported regardless.

### 2.5 ⭐ Human validation (the single most important task of the thesis)
1. Stratified sample: 100 per cluster = **300 Bangla reviews**.
2. **3 native annotators**, blind to cluster labels, given operational definitions + 10 practice examples + a written guideline (released later).
3. **Report both:** **Fleiss' κ** and **Krippendorff's α (ordinal)** — personas are ordinal (engagement levels), so ordinal α credits near-misses. Under class imbalance also report **Gwet's AC1** (kappa-paradox guard).
4. Majority vote = **gold set**. K-Means vs gold → κ + confusion matrix.
5. English side: a 100-sample check if annotators exist, else an honest limitation.

**Decision rule:** α ≥ 0.80 reliable; **0.667–0.80 tentative-acceptable (Krippendorff's own bands)**; α < 0.667 → revise guideline + re-annotate. Still < 0.667 after two revisions → reframe: *"we impose a theory-driven three-tier scheme and validate its learnability"* — weaker but honest and publishable.

**Base papers:** Rousseeuw 1987; Tibshirani et al. 2001; Tibshirani & Walther 2005; Hubert & Arabie 1985; Fraley & Raftery 2002 (GMM/BIC); Campello et al. 2013 + McInnes et al. 2017 (HDBSCAN); Krippendorff 2019; Artstein & Poesio 2008; Miller & Alexander 2025 (arXiv 2502.17020 — multi-resolution alternative to "single optimal K"); MoP; BluePrint/SIMPACT.
**Deliverables:** master K-table, GMM/HDBSCAN robustness note, multi-encoder ARI/AMI, theory paragraph, persona definitions + profiles + external-validity cross-tab, 300-review gold set, κ+α report.

## PHASE 3 — Verifier Training: A/B + Calibration (Weeks 5–7)

> 🎯 Goal: Claim 2 — "the verifier is a valid, calibrated instrument," plus the Goodhart-test prerequisite.

### 3.1 Two separate verifiers (both languages)
| | Role | Ever sees |
|---|---|---|
| **Verifier-A** | The in-loop gate | Generation-time scores |
| **Verifier-B** | Evaluation only | Never enters the loop |

Different seeds + disjoint train splits (2-fold swap). **Without this, every result is circular.**
- Bangla: fine-tune `csebuetnlp/banglabert` (batch 16, lr 2e-5, 4–6 epochs, early stop) — ~30–40 min on free Colab.
- English: `distilroberta-base` (small, fair — a large English model would poison the comparison).

### 3.2 Verifier backbone ablation — the empirical answer to "why only BanglaBERT?"
| Backbone | Params | Why a candidate |
|---|---|---|
| `csebuetnlp/banglabert` | 110M | Bangla-native ELECTRA; Bhattacharjee et al. (Findings of NAACL 2022) — SOTA on multiple Bangla NLU tasks |
| `xlm-roberta-base` | 270M | Strong multilingual baseline — without beating it, the "Bangla-specific model is needed" claim collapses |
| `google/muril-base-cased` | 236M | Indic-specialized (17 languages incl. Bangla) |
| `bert-base-multilingual-cased` | 178M | Historical baseline |
- Protocol: identical R1 training / identical budget (lr {2e-5, 3e-5} × 4 epochs, seed 42) → macro-F1 on the same weak-label test **and the same gold-300**. One table; the winner becomes the Verifier.
- Either outcome wins: BanglaBERT wins → the choice is empirically proven; XLM-R wins → use it, and "monolingual vs multilingual verifier in low-resource" is itself a small finding.
- English side matched: quick `distilroberta-base` vs `roberta-base` check → pick a size-matched pair to avoid capacity confounds.
- Cost: 4 backbones × ~30 min Colab = half a day. One table + two sentences in the paper.

### 3.3 Evaluation — report both numbers
1. **Weak-label test set:** ~87% expected → "label reproduction accuracy."
2. **300-item human gold:** likely 65–75% → **"true persona detection accuracy"** — the real number; the gap between the two is itself an honest, citable contribution.

### 3.4 Calibration (hidden contribution)
Reliability diagram (10 bins), **ECE**, Brier score → **temperature scaling** → ECE before/after. The threshold gate stands on confidence; miscalibrated confidence makes τ meaningless. *Base: Guo et al., ICML 2017.*

### 3.5 Symbolic scorer — full specification (text-only features)
- Feature pool (no emoji — absent from data): intensifier count, positive/negative lexemes (ভালো/বাজে/ফালতু), length bucket, exclamation, negation, name mentions (where present), specificity terms (গান/অভিনয়/গল্প).
- Rule table in the appendix: rule ID, persona, feature, weight, provenance.
- **Never hand-set weights** — learn via logistic regression on the 200-item dev slice. Tune the 0.6/0.4 hybrid weight on dev too (grid 0.5–0.8) and report it.

**Deliverables:** 4 trained verifiers (A/B × bn/en), backbone-ablation table, dual-accuracy table, calibration figure, rule table.

---

## PHASE 4 — The Compound AI System: Building the Loop and Bringing It Alive (Weeks 7–9)

> 🎯 Goal: Claim 3 — earn the loop empirically. The old "100% / 1.0-attempt" meant the loop was dead.

### 4.0 Naming — what we call it, and what we refuse to call it (final)
The paper's identity sentence: **"a compound AI system (Zaharia et al., BAIR 2024) implementing the evaluator-optimizer workflow (Anthropic, *Building Effective Agents*, Dec 2024) — generator + external trained verifier + reflection loop, with role-separated deterministic and generative components."**
- **Never claim "autonomous multi-agent system"** — control flow is predefined and 2 of 4 components make no LLM calls; on Anthropic's workflow-vs-agent distinction, this is a workflow. This honest naming fully answers the "this is just a pipeline" attack.
- The title keeps "Multi-Agent Framework" (pre-defence-locked); the first Methods paragraph carries the definition above — an honesty bridge between title and content.

### 4.1 System state — the heart of the LangGraph
```python
State = {
  plot: str, target_persona: str,          # immutable input
  retrieved: list[review_id],              # written by Researcher
  draft: str,                              # written/updated by Writer
  neural_score: float, symbolic_score: float, gate_score: float,
  verdict: PASS | FAIL,                    # written by Critic
  feedback: str | None,                    # written by Reflector
  attempt: int (max 3),
  trace: list[full snapshot of every previous attempt]   # nothing is lost
}
```

### 4.2 The four component contracts (input → work → output → design justification)

**1 — Researcher** (deterministic tool-caller, no LLM call)
- In: `plot, target_persona` → ChromaDB query from plot key-phrases + persona filter (**R1 index only**, cosine, top-10, within same persona label) → Out: `retrieved`.
- On retry (query-drift fix): the original persona+plot query **always stays anchored**; feedback keywords only **augment**, never replace. Log exemplar overlap per attempt — if overlap <50% with no pass-rate gain, disable re-retrieval and route retries straight to the Writer (this is the §5.1b routing ablation).
- Justification: a non-parametric form of MoP's exemplar conditioning.

**2 — Writer** (the only generative component)
- In: `plot, persona, retrieved, feedback?` → prompt order: [persona operational definition — verbatim from Phase 2] + [10 retrieved exemplars] + [plot] + on retry [previous draft + Reflector feedback + "fix exactly these issues"].
- Params: temp 0.8, top_p 0.9, seed logged. Out: `draft` (Bangla). Prompt templates go verbatim in the appendix.

**3 — Critic** (deterministic judge — explicitly not an LLM; this is the thesis's central claim)
- In: `draft, target_persona` → `gate_score = VerifierA(draft)`, compared
  with τ → Out: `verdict + neural score + symbolic diagnostic score`.

> 🔴 **`0.6 / 0.4` IS STRUCK — 2026-08-11, Sabbir's rule: *"hate likha thakle hbe na. karon thakte hobe."*** The spec called these *"dev-tuned weights, §3.5"*, but **no tuning ever produced them** — they are the number this whole audit started from, and tracing them found no derivation anywhere in the repo.
>
> ⚠️ **They are also not *tunable* as written.** Verifier-A scores **0.9866 — one error in 82** — so every weight in §5.1b's 0.5–0.8 grid returns the same verdict, and the *"symbolic adds <2 points"* rule would have to resolve **1.6 dev items**. The sweep as specified is degenerate.
>
> **What replaces it** (registered in `protocol.md`, 2026-08-11): `w` is fit on the **30 dev-plots' generated outputs** — where the Critic actually operates, and where `kapur2026length` says the length/specificity relation *differs* from human text — and reported as a **sensitivity curve, never a point**. Inclusion of the symbolic term must survive a **held-out marginal-value test**, not a standalone score: `barata2026hybrid` rejected a cheap component in **50 of 50 folds** while it looked fine standalone.
>
> **S4.5a RAN 2026-08-18.** Every held-out fold selected `w=1`; mean
> delta-AUC against neural-only was 0.0000 in both registered conditions.
> Therefore no `w` is selected. The neural score alone controls PASS/FAIL;
> the symbolic score remains active only to localise failed rules for the
> Reflector. This is a negative result for RQ3's hybrid-accuracy hypothesis,
> not removal of the symbolic component.
- Justification: **Self-Correction Illusion (2606.05976)** — external-role feedback is what works; **CRITIC (ICLR 2024)** — the judge is a tool, not the model itself. The Critic is never the Writer's model — that separation is the architecture's soul.
- ⚠️ τ chosen to hit a pass-rate is itself a proxy — so τ is set **on dev-plots**, and the final τ is sanity-checked against Verifier-B scores, not only A.

**4 — Reflector** (small generative call, FAIL only)
- In: `draft, scores, failed-rule list` → structured feedback — not random critique but **which symbolic rules failed + which persona the neural confidence leaned toward**, rendered in natural language (e.g., "no intensifiers [R1 failed]; reads Indifferent-cold — raise emotion, name the lead actor") → Out: `feedback`.
- Justification: Reflexion (NeurIPS 2023) — verbal feedback memory; ours is verifier-grounded, not self-generated. Error-localized feedback beats generic (Self-Refine ablation; Tyen et al. 2024).

**Loop control:** FAIL & attempt<3 → back to Researcher (anchored+augmented query). FAIL & attempt=3 → emit best-of-3 by Verifier-A gate score with `gave_up=True` — the raw material of the failure taxonomy; report all metrics split by `gave_up` status.

### 4.3 ⚠️ Pre-empting "is this really multi-agent?"
Be honest: two of four components are deterministic. Three defences, written explicitly in the paper:
1. Use the §4.0 naming verbatim — compound AI system + evaluator-optimizer (BAIR 2024; Anthropic 2024); with no autonomy claim there is nothing to attack.
2. Role-separation *is* the scientific point: generator and judge are distinct entities — the direct application of the Self-Correction Illusion role-label finding.
3. The ablation table proves each component earns its place (rows 3 vs 4 vs 6 vs 7) — none is decorative.

### 4.4 Instrumentation
Full state snapshot per attempt in `trace`; JSONL dump per run — the substrate of dynamics analysis + failure taxonomy. RAG index = R1 only; G never (leakage). ~~Generator: Groq primary (20-generation pilot → Llama vs Qwen); Gemini secondary on a subset.~~

> ⛔ **CORRECTED 2026-08-12 (protocol.md, four rows dated 2026-08-12).** Generation runs on **our own GPU (Kaggle T4), not a hosted API** — no free API supplies ~10M tokens of Bangla (eight checked); the cause is budget and is logged as budget, and it narrows the `2601.17768` reproducibility concession: locally the batch is chosen and the seed set (**batch size 8 = provenance, not a knob**). Pilot arms re-registered: **`google/gemma-3-12b-it` vs `md-nishat-008/TigerLLM-9B-it`** — same base (both Gemma3ForCausalLM, verified from each `config.json`), one variable: Bangla adaptation. The 1B pair was tried and failed (1 of 3 usable; hand-read, n=3, NOT A RESULT). "Llama vs Qwen" was already dead on 2026-08-11 (Qwen is a Groq Preview model); its replacement "Llama vs GPT-OSS" differed in three ways at once and is superseded. arXiv 2503.10995 does **not** describe the TigerLLM uploads (paper says LLaMA-3.2/Gemma-2; weights are Gemma-3, "9B" = 12.19B) — no claim may rest on its benchmark table. The 27 Groq generations (`results/pilot_s4_generations.jsonl`) are retained for the Llama fertility measurement (0.93 chars/token; Gemma-3: 3.71) and may never be merged with local generations. Runner: `notebooks/s4_pilot_kaggle.ipynb` + `configs/s4_pilot_local.yaml`.
>
> ⛔ **PILOT RUN 1 IS VOID AS A COMPARISON (2026-08-12, evening).** `TigerLLM-9B-it`'s uploaded weights are `gemma-3-12b-it` **byte-for-byte** (SHA-256 `4847447e…` on shard 1 of both), so both arms ran the same model and 37 of 40 generation pairs came out identical. **Ruling (Sabbir delegated, reasoning Claude's): the pilot is not re-run; the generator is fixed at `google/gemma-3-12b-it`, single-arm, and the Bangla-adapted comparison becomes a pre-registered robustness check** (open decision 22). The single-backbone bound is stated in Ch.5 Limitations citing `2604.04532`. 🎁 Salvage: the accidental double-run is a **passed determinism check** — identical seed → identical generations across two loads, which the hosted API could not have given. Measured on the 80 valid generations: truncation **2/80**, mean **22 words** (corpus median 8), non-Bangla-script leakage **1/20 under Bangla prompts vs 4/20 under English prompts** — the first data point for the §3e prompt-language factor.

### 4.5 Threshold sweep — the central task
- ~~τ = 0.30 → 0.95 (step 0.05)~~ **τ swept at QUANTILES of the observed score distribution** (corrected 2026-08-11, decision 17), each τ on the **30 dev-plots** × **2 axis levels**; the 20-generation model pilot uses this dev set too.

> 🔑 **Why the uniform grid was replaced, and why the calibrated/uncalibrated question was dropped.** Temperature scaling is **accuracy-preserving** — `mattei2026welltempered` prove it is the *only* accuracy-preserving linear scaler — so it cannot move an item across a threshold, and calibrated vs raw τ are **reparametrisations of the same partition**. Confirmed on dev-82: **0 rank inversions**. The defect was never the scores; it was the grid. On the old uniform grid, calibrated scores gave **5 distinct pass-sets against raw's 12**, and were **flat for 8 consecutive grid points**. Thresholds placed at observed score values give **81 operating points on either scale**. **Report on the calibrated scale** so τ reads as a probability (`kotte2026ucci`, Thm 1). ✅ **Decision 19 CLOSED 2026-08-11 — τ is now derived, and ~~"first-pass 60–70%"~~ is struck.**
>
> The cost objective **alone is degenerate**: calls-per-accepted falls monotonically in the pass rate (16.310 at q=0.10 → 1.020 at q=0.99), so minimising it selects **τ = 0**. The 60–70% target was a constraint wearing an optimum's clothes.
>
> **Following `kotte2026ucci` §3, the constraint is bounded by two measured endpoints, and ours are already §5.1 rows:**
> - **α_lo** — τ=0, the Critic never rejects: **row 3, RAG-only, 1 call**.
>   Corrected 2026-08-20 before Phase-5 generation: the frozen attempt-1
>   archive contains ten retrieved exemplars and was never zero-shot.
> - **α_hi** — an explicit **FORCED-3 policy**: every plot runs all 3
>   attempts and best-of-3 is emitted. This is not represented as `τ=1`,
>   because calibrated Verifier-A scores can equal exactly 1.0 and the Critic's
>   registered `>=` comparison would pass them early.
>
> 🔑 **Both measured by Verifier-B, never Verifier-A** (rule 6 — A is inside the loop). This is stricter than UCCI, which has no such wall.
>
> **Headline point, no free constant:** τ\* = **argmax [quality(τ) − α_lo] / E[calls](τ)**. UCCI picked 74.1% of the achievable range; choosing our own fraction would reintroduce a hand-written constant, so the argmax replaces it. **The full frontier is the deliverable** (their Fig. 2); τ\* names a point on it.
>
> Procedure and cost model: `src/eval/tau_objective.py`, pre-registered before any generation exists.
- Plot: first-attempt pass rate, avg attempts, final acceptance, and **Verifier-B score** (independent quality).
- ~~**Pick the operating point where first-attempt pass ≈ 60–70%** → the Reflector fires on 30–40% of cases → the loop's behavior becomes measurable.~~ ⛔ **STRUCK 2026-08-11 (decision 19).** This bullet survived four lines below the box that strikes it — logged as a maintenance failure in `protocol.md`. **Replaced by the derived τ\* above.** The *motivation* is retained and is still right — a loop that passes everything is dead — but it is now observed on the frontier rather than imposed as a target, because a target that cannot be derived is a constraint wearing an optimum's clothes.
- **Temperature schedule (ablation only):** retry temps 0.8→0.9→1.0 — a published diversity mechanism for escaping mode-collapsed drafts; measure in §5.1b, do not bake in.

## PHASE 5 — The Experiment: Ablations × 2 Languages (Weeks 9–12)

### 5.1 Main ablation table (identical in both languages)
| # | Condition | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Zero-shot axis-level prompt | Is prompting enough? |
| 2 | Few-shot (static examples) | Do examples alone suffice? |
| 3 | RAG only (no verifier) | Retrieval's contribution |
| 4 | RAG + neural-only verifier + loop, **no symbolic diagnostics in feedback** | Do symbolic diagnostics help the correction step? |
| 5 | RAG + symbolic-only gate + loop | Is neural gating needed? |
| 6 | **Proposed: RAG + neural gate + symbolic diagnostic feedback** | Gate/diagnosis separation established by S4.5a |
| 7a | ⭐ Intrinsic self-critique (same LLM critiques itself) | **Intrinsic vs trained-extrinsic — headline baseline** |
| 7b | External-role self-critique; same critique bytes as 7a, re-presented under `user` role | Does role relabelling explain an apparent external-critic gain? |
| 8 | LLM-as-judge critic (Gemini judges) | Cheap trained verifier vs large LLM judge |
| 9 | RAG + blind resampling + Verifier-A best-of-budget selection | Does refinement beat fresh sampling at matched inference compute? |

- **Scale:** per replicate, **90** eval-plots (never dev-plots) × **2 axis levels** × **10 conditions = 1,800 condition-cases per language**. Three pre-declared sampling replicates (`42, 43, 44`) make **5,400/language and 10,800 across both languages**. These are not generation-call counts: rows 4–9 are multi-call and every realized input/output token count is logged. Replicates are a sensitivity/blocking factor, never a best-seed selection surface. 🔴 **Amended 2026-08-20 before Phase-5 generation:** decisions 9 and 11 added two strong controls after the 2025–26 literature audit.
- **Row 2 non-retrieved few-shot rule (amended before generation):** draw ten R1 region-A examples per target level independently for each plot × level × replicate, using a SHA-256-derived RNG from `(42, replicate_seed, plot_id, target_level)` after sorting review IDs. The draw never uses plot text, similarity, an outcome, R2 or G. Thus it is instance-randomized few-shot, not retrieval; the full schedule digest is frozen at preflight. This supersedes the same-day fixed-set rule after Li et al. (EMNLP 2025) showed fixed random-factor settings can bias comparisons and instance-level randomization reduces variance.
- **Row 5 symbolic gate (frozen before generation):** on the 60 frozen length-controlled Bangla dev attempt-1 cases, choose the symbolic threshold whose acceptance rate is closest to row 6's observed neural first-pass rate (39/60 = 0.65), breaking an exact-distance tie toward the stricter threshold. This gives **tau_symbolic = 0.18166513482099075** and exactly **39/60** passes. Verifier-B is not used.
- **Row 8 judge contract (amended 2026-08-21 before generation):** `gemini-3.6-flash` through the v1beta Interactions API, with `seed=42` and explicit `thinking_level=medium`. Gemini 3.6 no longer accepts a temperature parameter. Structured JSON contains `verdict ∈ {PASS, FAIL}`, integer `target_fit_score ∈ [0,100]`, and Bangla `feedback` of at most two sentences (empty on PASS). The judge sees the exact axis definition, requested level, plot, and draft; it never sees Verifier-A/B. At most three Writer drafts are attempted. If all fail, emit the highest judge score, breaking ties toward the earliest draft. Raw responses, exact model ID, seed, thinking level, token usage, and latency are retained; Verifier-B scores final text only. This supersedes the inaccessible `gemini-2.5-flash` contract after Google's live endpoint told this new-user account to migrate; no eval generation existed when amended.
- **Row 9 matching rule (frozen before generation):** generate a nested pool of at most five independent Writer samples from the exact row-3 RAG prompt, with no prior draft or feedback. Verifier-A selects the best prefix; the primary prefix size is the largest whose realized generator FLOPs do not exceed row 6's realized generator FLOPs for the same plot/level. Selection uses A; outcome scoring uses B. Report the full prefix frontier 1–5 and all token/FLOP totals.
- **Rows 7a/7b role control (frozen before generation):** share the initial draft and critique text. SHA-256 must confirm identical critique bytes; only the wrapper/chat role changes for the revision, and the revision seed is shared. Row 7b uses the `user` role, selected before data because it is the strongest natural external source for logical/textual claims in `selfcorrectionillusion2026` and avoids treating generated critique as trusted system memory.
- **Paired call schedule:** rows 3–9 share one physical, byte-identical initial RAG draft per plot/level/replicate, while each condition retains that call in its logical cost. Rows 4 and 6 use the same number of Reflector calls and the same feedback renderer; row 4 supplies an empty diagnostic list and row 6 supplies symbolic rule names. Physical reuse, logical cost, per-call RNG seed, and token totals are all archived separately.
- **Checkpoint compatibility:** before any model load, every restored S5 JSONL must parse completely, have unique keys, and identify the exact clean runner commit. A runtime RAG rebuild must match the committed R1-only manifest's nine scientific invariants without rewriting that tracked artifact; the config-relative persistence path is host-local and not an identity field. A dirty or cross-commit checkpoint is refused rather than mixed into one result table.
- Row 7a < Row 6, while row 6 also exceeds 7b and row 9 at matched cost → evidence specifically for trained external verification rather than extra compute or role relabelling. Any other ordering narrows the claim and is reported as such.
- Row 8 ≈ Row 6 at 1/40th the cost → the efficiency claim. (Note LLM-judge biases to discuss: position, verbosity, self-preference; degraded reliability in lower-resource languages — further motivation for a *trained* critic.)

### 5.1b Mini-ablations (small, on dev-plots, bn only)
| Ablation | Measures |
|---|---|
| Retry → Researcher vs Retry → Writer | Does re-retrieval help, or drift? |
| Hybrid weight sweep (neural 0.5–0.8) | 0.6/0.4 is not arbitrary — sensitivity curve; if symbolic adds <~2 points over neural-only, soften the hybrid claim |
| k ∈ {3, 5, 10} exemplars | Optimal k for style imitation |
| Temperature schedule on/off | Is retry-diversity worth it? |

### 5.2 Metrics (per condition, per language)
| Metric | Measures | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Persona accuracy (**via Verifier-B**, never A) | Controllability | — |
| Human persona match (100 samples × 3 annotators) | True controllability | Phase-2 team |
| distinct-1/2, Self-BLEU | Diversity / template repetition | nltk |
| MAUVE (+ FID optional) | Real-vs-generated alignment — **MoP-comparable** | `mauve-text` |
| JS divergence (length, sentiment dist.) | Realism | scipy |
| Cost + latency (**per-attempt marginal cost vs marginal gain** — ~60% of agentic cost sits in refinement; this table prices each retry) | Practicality | logs |

### 5.3 ⚠️ The Goodhart test (this opens the Q1 door)
Verifier-A and Verifier-B scores side by side per condition:
- A↑ and B↑ → genuine improvement ✅
- A↑ but B flat → verifier gaming — also publishable, possibly the most interesting finding.
- **Formal metric:** plot the **(A−B) gap as a function of attempt number** — a widening gap means overoptimization is occurring (direct descendant of Gao et al. 2022 reward-model overoptimization; a held-out verifier is the literature's standard mitigation — **this design is our strongest novelty hook; foreground it**).

### 5.4 Plot-level realism test (redesigned — film mapping is impossible)
- **Corpus-level distributional realism:** all generated reviews per persona vs that persona's real reviews → **MAUVE + JS(length) + JS(sentiment-classifier output)**.
- **Persona-mix sanity:** unconditional generation on the 90 eval-plots → Verifier-B label distribution vs the corpus's observed persona proportions (whatever S2 yields) → JS.
- **Mandatory Limitations sentence:** *"Our data lacks review-to-film mapping; hence we validate distributional realism at corpus level, not per-film audience prediction. 'Simulation' should be read as persona-conditioned response generation, not validated predictive audience modeling."*

### 5.5 Cross-lingual comparison
The key table: Δ (improvement over zero-shot) per condition — English column vs Bangla column, with the fertility covariate alongside. Claims per outcome as specified in §1.2. Never present the raw gap as pure "language difficulty."

### 5.6 Statistics
- **Paired bootstrap** (10,000 resamples, 95% CI) for the main metrics; **McNemar** for paired binary outcomes.
- **Multiple-comparison correction: Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR)** across the **10 conditions** (or Holm — state which). Never "p<0.05" alone — always effect sizes (Cohen's d or absolute Δ + CI).
- **Exactly 3 pre-declared sampling replicates (`42,43,44`) per arm.** All comparisons are paired within plot/level/replicate. Replicate mean±SD is descriptive sensitivity only, never the decision rule or a best-seed selection surface; primary inference is paired at case level with replicate retained as a blocking factor.
- **N=300 justification:** show the bootstrap-CI width at 300 and the minimum detectable effect; cite Card et al. 2020 (EMNLP, "With Little Power Comes Great Responsibility").
- *Framework: Dror et al. 2018 (ACL), "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Testing Statistical Significance in NLP."*

**Deliverables:** master results table (10 × 2 languages), Goodhart figures (incl. A−B vs attempt), realism figure, cross-lingual Δ table, mini-ablation table, stats appendix.

## PHASE 7 — Q1 COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST (none of this existed at pre-defence)

### 7.1 HARD — no review without these
- [ ] **Limitations section** — mandatory at ACL/ARR (desk-reject without it since Dec 2023); after the conclusion; excluded from page limits; organized by the four validity types.
- [ ] **Responsible NLP checklist** filed correctly (since Dec 2024 ARR desk-rejects incorrect/incomplete filing): artifact licenses, intended use, PII acknowledgment, **compute budget (GPU-hours, hardware)**, **all hyperparameters + search ranges**, number of runs + variance, annotation/ethics details — each with section pointers.
- [ ] **Generative-AI declaration** — the LLM as research object (Methods) and any writing assistance (Elsevier: a statement immediately above the references). AI cannot be an author.
- [ ] **Journal-specific (if IPM/Elsevier):** CRediT author-contribution statement + Data Availability statement — verify against the live Guide for Authors at submission.
- [ ] **Ethics status statement:** if CU has an ethics committee, obtain a determination letter; if not, state so explicitly + safeguards (annotator informed consent, fair compensation, anonymization).

### 7.2 NORM — reviewers cut without these
- [ ] **Human-eval documentation:** annotator count/recruitment/compensation/native-speaker status, released guidelines, rating instrument, randomization+blinding, κ+α, CIs. Complete a **HEDS (Human Evaluation Datasheet; HEDS 3.0, 2024)**.
- [ ] **Datasheets for Datasets** (Gebru et al. 2021) + **Data Statement for NLP** (Bender & Friedman 2018) — name the variety: Bangladeshi Bangla, Bengali script.
- [ ] **Model Card** (Mitchell et al. 2019) for the verifier.
- [ ] **Agent Card + state-machine diagram + sample traces** — the emerging documentation standard for agent systems (MICAI 2025); LangGraph figure + shared-state schema + released `trace[]` samples.
- [ ] **Data licensing/privacy (scraped FB/YouTube):** follow the Bangla precedent — SentiGOLD (arXiv 2306.06147): public-API collection + anonymization + non-commercial academic license; ToxLex_bn (Data in Brief 2022): dedupe + anonymize → Mendeley. Rules: strip usernames/PII, release **text+labels only**; if ToS blocks redistribution → gated/on-request or ID+rehydration release. One-line academic fair-use rationale for review copyright.
- [ ] **Bender Rule:** name the language explicitly from the abstract onward — "Bangla (Bengali), Bangladeshi variety, Bengali script." Native-speaker involvement statement.
- [ ] **English gloss for every Bangla example** (ideal: original script + transliteration + translation).

### 7.3 NICE — visibly above the bar
- [ ] Multi-resolution K analysis Sankey (Miller & Alexander 2025 style)
- [ ] Gwet's AC1 robustness agreement
- [ ] Publicly timestamped protocol.md — proof that the story was not written after the results

## PHASE 8 — Demo, Defence & Dissemination (after S6, ~1 week total)

> ⚠️ Wrappers, not contributions — not one day here before S6 is done.

### 8.1 Streamlit "Audience Simulator" v2 (2–3 days)
Rebuild the existing app (movie-review-agent.streamlit.app) on the new LangGraph backend: plot in → ~~3 persona reviews~~ **2 axis-level reviews** 🔴 **[D12 wording]** + hybrid scores + attempt counts + **the Reflector's feedback trace made visible** — self-correction you can watch; the defence show-piece. Hosting: Streamlit Community Cloud or HF Spaces (both free); if the 110M verifier is heavy, call it via HF Inference API. In the paper, one line: "A publicly accessible demonstration is available at <URL>."

### 8.2 Defence package (2 days)
Slide order = problem → the writer-examiner metaphor → split-map figure → master K-table → ablation table → Goodhart figure → live demo. Memorize the 2-minute summary; prepare the four expected questions: ~~"why 3 personas"~~ 🔴 **[D12]** **"why 2 levels, and why not clusters"** — the honest answer is §2.1–2.3 *plus* the negative results in steps 9 and 11, which is a stronger answer than the original question expected (§2.1–2.3), "why only BanglaBERT" (§3.2), "is this really multi-agent" (§4.0/4.3), "did you validate simulation?" (§5.4 + Limitations).

### 8.3 Dissemination (2 days)
Public GitHub (code + configs + timestamped protocol.md), updated HF model card, new Mendeley dataset version (gold-300 labels + guideline, under §7.2 licensing rules).

## 🗂 LEGACY ASSETS — carried over from the pre-defence report & conference paper

| Asset | Status | Role in v7 |
|---|---|---|
| HF model `shksabbir7/bengali-movie-review-classifier` | Published (cited in the paper) | Kept as the v1 artifact; **the new verifier is retrained** (v1 was trained on a leaked split) — document v1→v2 differences in the model card |
| Streamlit app movie-review-agent.streamlit.app | Live (single/batch/history UI) | Rebuilt on the new backend in Phase 8; UI structure reusable |
| Old hyperparameters: lr 2e-5/2.5e-5, 4–6 epochs, batch 16 | Tested | Starting grid for §3.1 — keeps the new search small |
| Old thresholds 0.7 / 0.45 / 0.6 | Used | **Superseded** — reported only as the comparison point for the new τ-sweep |
| Per-class table: Enthusiastic Casual recall **0.5674** | Paper Table I | Evidence of the middle persona's weakness — source of the §4.6 retry-rate hypothesis |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash (old Writer) | Used | Now the **secondary** robustness generator |
| LangGraph + ChromaDB + LaBSE stack | Used | Unchanged — proven to work |

**To correct in the thesis text:** unify the "9,998→6,114" vs "5,000 raw" story (S0 is the truth); delete the meaningless "6,114 representing 612 of 9,998" sentence; the 97.5% CV (LaBSE+LogReg) and 87.49% (BanglaBERT) are different experiments — un-conflate them in the abstract; remove the TF-IDF/Count-Vectorization and stemming/stopword sections (unused/harmful); resolve the emoji-tables-vs-emoji-free-data inconsistency; and never present "100% accuracy, 1.0 attempts" as success — discuss it as evidence of a dead loop.

## 📝 THESIS INTRODUCTION BLUEPRINT (write Chapter 1 to this structure)

**1.1 Background (3 paragraphs):** ① The Bangladeshi film industry's absence of pre-release audience feedback, and the rise of LLM persona simulation as a proposed remedy; ② but 2025–26 evidence shows prompt-only persona control is unreliable (Sands et al., NCAA 2026; WWW 2026 Companion) and intrinsic self-correction fails (Huang et al., ICLR 2024; The Self-Correction Illusion, 2026); ③ both problems sharpen in low-resource languages — Bangla as the testbed.

**1.2 Motivation:** the solution's pieces exist in separate literatures — persona generation (MoP), classifier gating (FUDGE/detox line), refinement loops (math/code) — **no one has joined them in a low-resource language**; a cheap trained verifier makes the approach practical for a real industry.

**1.3 Problem statement (one sentence):** *Whether an external task-trained
verifier embedded in a generate–verify–refine loop measurably improves control
of a human-recognizable engagement-specificity axis in Bangla text generation,
relative to prompting-alone and self-critique baselines, without collapsing the
independent evaluation wall.*

**1.4 Research questions:**
- **RQ1:** Can a meaningful response distinction be recovered from unlabeled
  Bangla reviews and validated as stable and human-recognizable?
- **RQ2:** To what extent do verifier-guided generation and the registered
  prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), self-critique,
  external-judge, and resampling controls improve target-level controllability
  over zero-shot generation in Bangla?
- **RQ3:** What role does symbolic information play when used for acceptance
  gating and for diagnostic feedback within verifier-guided Bangla response
  generation?
- **RQ4:** Does iteration against Verifier-A create measurable divergence from
  an independent Verifier-B?

> **Post-run wording amendment (2026-08-23; no experiment changed):** the
> original RQs used *persona discovery/persona controllability* and framed RQ4
> as a completed low-resource comparison. Those words conflict with the audited
> outcomes: the operational object is a human-recognizable two-level cut through
> an engagement-specificity continuum, and the English mirror is deferred. The
> current wording above also limits RQ2's confirmatory comparison to the frozen
> condition-versus-zero-shot family; active-condition orderings remain
> descriptive. It matches `docs/STATUS.md` and
> `docs/thesis_rq_evidence_map.md`. Historical pre-registration remains intact
> in `docs/protocol.md`.

**1.5 Objectives:** one operational line per RQ (from protocol.md).

**1.6 Contributions (seven):** ① a human-validated, persona-labeled Bangla review dataset with a 300-item gold set and released guidelines; ② a convergence-validated persona-discovery protocol (7 criteria + stability + theory); ③ a calibrated, cheap persona verifier with dual-accuracy reporting (weak-label vs gold); ④ a compound AI system implementing the evaluator-optimizer workflow with a trained-classifier gate — *to our knowledge* the first for persona control in a low-resource language; ⑤ an A/B held-out-verifier evaluation design for detecting Goodhart effects in refinement loops; ⑥ cross-lingual evidence (Δ_bn vs Δ_en) on where verification matters most; ⑦ full open release: code, model, traces, demo.

**1.7 Scope & limitations preview:** “Audience response generation” means
axis-level-conditioned text generation; per-film audience prediction and
box-office forecasting are not validated because the data lacks review-to-film
mapping. G1 found no separated cluster structure. The supported construct is a
two-level cut through a continuum that human annotators can nonetheless
recognise (RQ1-H: 0.78/0.84 vs 0.25 chance). Pinto et al. (2026) and
Cornelissen et al. (2026) report related geometric cautions; neither supplies
this study's human comparative validation.

**1.8 Thesis organization:** per the §6.1 chapter map.
