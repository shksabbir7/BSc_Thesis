# Thesis research-question evidence map

**Frozen working title:** *A Neuro-Symbolic Multi-Agent Framework for
Pre-Release Audience Response Generation in Bangla Cinema: A
Verifier-in-the-Loop Approach*

**Audit date:** 2026-08-23
**Purpose:** bind every research question to existing audited evidence, its
defensible conclusion, and its planned thesis presentation. This document does
not introduce a new analysis or authorize a generation rerun.

## Terminology and source conflict

The normative pipeline's original RQ1 asks whether *personas* can be discovered.
That wording was superseded by the later registered evidence and terminology
decision recorded in `docs/STATUS.md`: silhouette 0.053, a monotonically rising
gap statistic and 100% HDBSCAN noise do not support discrete clusters or
audience types. The thesis therefore studies a reproducible two-level cut
through an engagement-specificity continuum. `cluster_k2` remains only a frozen
variable name. This map uses the current Chapter 1 wording and preserves the
negative clusterability result rather than silently rewriting it as discovery.

## Summary map

| RQ | Current question | Evidential status | Defensible one-sentence answer | Main chapter |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RQ1 | Can a meaningful response distinction be recovered from unlabeled Bangla reviews and validated as stable and human-recognizable? | **Qualified support** | A reproducible Region-A cut is human-recognizable as engagement specificity under length-matched comparative judgment, but it is a continuum cut rather than a discovered persona/cluster and does not replicate structurally in Region B. | 3 |
| RQ2 | To what extent do verifier-guided generation and the registered prompting, RAG, self-critique, external-judge and resampling controls improve target-level controllability over zero-shot generation in Bangla? | **Supported within the completed Bangla arm, with attribution limits** | All nine registered active conditions improve out-of-loop Verifier-B target scores over zero-shot and requested levels are human-recoverable, but the result does not identify the verifier as the sole cause, establish active-condition superiority or support audience prediction. | 6–7 |
| RQ3 | What role does symbolic information play when used for acceptance gating and for diagnostic feedback within verifier-guided Bangla response generation? | **Roles differentiated / incremental value remains exploratory** | Symbolic-only acceptance gating is weak, whereas symbolic rules remain useful for diagnostic revision guidance under a neural gate; the combined condition performs strongly against zero-shot, but its incremental advantage over neural-only remains exploratory. | 5–7 |
| RQ4 | Does iteration against Verifier-A create measurable divergence from an independent Verifier-B? | **Supported as a diagnostic, not human-quality decline** | On continuing failed cases, neural-loop revisions widen the A–B score gap in the direction expected under proxy overoptimization; Verifier-B is an independent held-out proxy, not ground truth. | 6–7 |

## RQ1 — construct recovery and human recognizability

### Load-bearing evidence

- Full-corpus confound: `results/s2_cluster_assignments.csv` and
  `results/s2c_region_split.md`; the apparent clusters predominantly recover
  corpus source, including 93.3% binary source-identification accuracy.
- Region-A stability and clusterability: `results/s2d_ktable_regionA.md`;
  K=2 prediction strength 0.860 and bootstrap ARI 0.940 ± 0.029 coexist with
  silhouette 0.053, no gap-selected K and 100% HDBSCAN noise.
- Construct profiling and confound checks:
  `results/s2e_regionA_k2_profile.md` and
  `results/s2f_regionA_k2_residual.md`; length AUC 0.6764 and weak residual lift
  +9.80 percentage points are descriptive profiling, not post-clustering
  inferential proof.
- Negative control: `results/s2d_ktable_regionB.md`,
  `results/s2e_regionB_k2_profile.md` and
  `results/s2f_regionB_k2_residual.md`; the Region-A signature does not
  replicate even though a stable-looking Region-B bisection is recoverable.
- Failed ordinal instrument: `results/g300_agreement.md`; ordinal alpha 0.4970,
  so its downstream validity gate was not run.
- Successful comparative human validation: `results/intrusion_agreement.md`;
  annotator performance 0.780 and 0.840 against 0.25 chance, construct check
  0.850 for both annotators, items length-matched within two words, and the
  length heuristic scores 0.16.

### Claim boundary

The evidence supports a human-recognizable engagement-specificity distinction.
It does **not** support discovered personas, natural audience types, separated
clusters, or film-level audience prediction. Stability is reported as a
property of the algorithmic cut, not proof of natural categories.

- Table 3.2: read-only audit of the eleven registered S0 claims.
- Table 3.3: S1 cleaning cascade in execution order.
- Table 3.4: near-duplicate threshold sensitivity of the sentiment trap-check.

- Figure 3.1 (frozen data lineage) and Figure 3.2 (clusterability diagnostics)
  are **deferred** (Sabbir, 2026-08-25). Their content is carried by Tables 3.1,
  3.6 and 3.7, and the deferral is stated in the chapter text at both points, so
  no claim depends on a figure that does not exist.

## RQ2 — external verification and controllability

### Load-bearing evidence

- Frozen 20-cell results: `results/s5_main_bn_master_table.csv` and
  `results/s5_main_bn_reporting_tables_v2.md`.
- Nine planned paired comparisons against zero-shot:
  `results/s5_main_bn_paired_statistics.csv`; every registered active condition
  has a positive target-probability delta whose interval excludes zero.
- Largest registered zero-shot delta: neural gate with symbolic feedback,
  +0.2570 with 95% CI [0.2151, 0.2987]. This is a comparison with zero-shot,
  not with the neural-only loop.
- Independent outcome score: Verifier-B is trained on R2 and never enters the
  generation loop; its calibration improvement was not established.
- Blinded human validation: `results/s5_human_eval_bn_report.json`; pooled
  target-match accuracy 0.9133, 95% item-bootstrap CI [0.8667, 0.9567], raw
  agreement 0.88 and nominal alpha 0.8405. The frozen 100-item subset validates
  requested-level recoverability, not a ranking of all 20 cells.

### Claim boundary

RQ2 is supported for Bangla axis-level controllability. Because few-shot, RAG,
self-critique, hosted judging and blind resampling also improve over zero-shot,
the result does not show that only the proposed loop works or that it is
inferentially superior to another active condition. Verifier scores
measure reproduction of the constructed label; human judgments establish
recoverability of the requested level, not audience prediction, general quality
or plot faithfulness over all 5,400 outputs.

## RQ3 — symbolic acceptance gating and diagnostic feedback

### Load-bearing evidence

- Development weight study: `results/s35_symbolic.md` and the registered S4.5a
  result. Neural-only was selected in every held-out fold; mixture-minus-neural
  mean AUC delta was 0.0000, while verdicts still changed across the weight
  curve. The pre-registered interpretation remains unresolved rather than being
  forced into a favorable category.
- Main experiment: `results/s5_main_bn_master_table.csv`. Symbolic-only gating
  is weak and costly, especially at Level 1; neural-plus-symbolic feedback has
  the largest registered effect against zero-shot.
- Inferential limitation: the frozen confirmatory family contains no direct
  neural-plus-symbolic versus neural-only contrast. A later exploratory paired
  analysis uses the 540 already-frozen exact pairs and remains outside that
  family.

### Claim boundary

Symbolic diagnostics are defensible as feedback that names observable failure
modes. They are not established as an independently predictive gate. The
exploratory hybrid-minus-neural comparison estimates a +0.02159 target-
probability difference and +0.02037 binary-accuracy difference over 540 frozen
pairs; the probability estimate is concentrated at Level 0, while the exact
McNemar test for the binary contrast gives p=0.11728. This analysis does not
establish an incremental causal advantage or overall hybrid superiority.

- Table 6.1: descriptive neural-only, symbolic-only and combined cells.
- Chapters 7–8: explicit distinction between strong combined performance,
  exploratory incremental evidence and unestablished hybrid superiority.

## RQ4 — verifier divergence and Goodhart diagnostic

### Load-bearing evidence

- `results/s5_main_bn_goodhart_paired_transitions.csv` and
  `results/s5_main_bn_goodhart_report.json`.
- Neural loop: A–B gap change +0.182802 from attempts 1→2 (n=147) and
  +0.114836 from 2→3 (n=67).
- Neural plus symbolic feedback: +0.141481 (n=147) and +0.145979 (n=58).
- Symbolic loop: −0.042224 (n=193) and +0.001396 (n=165).
- `results/s5_main_bn_goodhart_figure.png` keeps failure-selected attempt means
  separate from valid same-case adjacent transitions.

### Claim boundary

The widening A–B gap is consistent with proxy overoptimization. It is not proof
that human quality declined, does not make Verifier-B an oracle, and applies to
the continuing failed-case transitions rather than all 540 cases in each
condition. Verifier-B's calibration improvement was not established and is
reported beside the diagnostic.

### Thesis presentation

- Table 6.4 or Appendix: exact adjacent-transition values and sample sizes.
- Chapter 7: proxy-divergence interpretation and residual validity threats.

## Cross-question safeguards

1. Gold-300 remains evaluation-only.
2. RAG uses R1 only; R2 never enters retrieval.
3. Verifier-B never enters generation, threshold selection or retry routing.
4. Seeds 42/43/44 are paired blocking/sensitivity factors, not independent
   study replications.
5. Length-matched S5 results are sensitivity evidence with coverage reported;
   they cannot rank conditions or establish length-neutral control.
6. No result in this map authorizes rerunning the frozen 5,400 generations.

## Integration checklist

- [x] Replace the obsolete persona wording in the normative pipeline through an
  explicit dated amendment; historical protocol remains unchanged.
- [x] Retain this detailed map as an audit artifact; state the four research
  questions directly in the concise Chapter 1 rather than duplicating their
  later answers in an introductory table.
- [x] Render the final bounded answers as Chapter 8 Table 8.1.
- [x] Use the artifact list above to build figure/table manifests.
