## Tier 1 — Load-bearing (the thesis argument collapses without these)

### [x] huang2024selfcorrect — Huang et al., ICLR 2024
*Large Language Models Cannot Self-Correct Reasoning Yet* · arXiv 2310.01798 v2
- **Role:** theoretical anchor. Justifies why the Critic must be **external**.
- **Feeds:** Ch.1 §1.1(2), Ch.2 §self-correction, RQ2 motivation, §5.1 ablation design.
- **Read:** 2026-08-01. ⚠️ **Read by Claude, not by Sabbir** — see the note at the
  end of this entry. Sections and table numbers below are from the arXiv v2 HTML.

**The claim, exactly as they scope it (§2, ¶ "Consequently…"):** they define
**intrinsic self-correction** as self-correction *"without any external or human
feedback"*, and state that all unqualified uses of "self-correction" in the
paper mean that setting. The finding is that LLMs *"struggle to self-correct
their responses without external feedback, and at times, their performance even
degrades"* (abstract).

**What the claim does NOT cover** — this is the boundary the entry was told to
find:
- Only **reasoning** benchmarks: GSM8K (1,319 items), CommonSenseQA (1,221 dev),
  HotpotQA (100). **No generation task, no persona control, no low-resource
  language.**
- Only **intrinsic** correction. External feedback is explicitly *endorsed*
  (below), not refuted.
- The title's *"Yet"* is load-bearing: they frame it as the current state, not a
  ceiling.
- Models tested: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-2-70b-chat.

**Numbers (Tables 2–4), accuracy %:**

| Setting | Model | GSM8K | CommonSenseQA | HotpotQA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard prompting | GPT-3.5 | 75.9 | 75.8 | 26.0 |
| Self-correct **with oracle** | GPT-3.5 | **84.3** | **89.7** | **29.0** |
| Self-correct **intrinsic**, r1 → r2 | GPT-3.5 | 75.1 → **74.7** | 38.1 → **41.8** | 25.0 → 25.0 |
| Standard prompting | GPT-4 | 95.5 | 82.0 | 49.0 |
| Self-correct **intrinsic**, r1 → r2 | GPT-4 | 91.5 → **89.0** | 79.5 → 80.0 | 49.0 → **43.0** |
| Standard prompting | Llama-2-70b | 62.0 | 64.0 | — |
| Self-correct **intrinsic**, r1 → r2 | Llama-2-70b | 43.5 → **36.5** | 37.5 → **36.5** | — |

Every intrinsic number is **at or below** its standard-prompting baseline. The
oracle row is the one that improves — and they argue (§3.2) that oracle results
*"can only be regarded as indicative of an oracle's performance"*, since if you
already hold the ground truth there is little reason to run the model at all.

**Why it degrades (§3.3):** on GSM8K, GPT-3.5 keeps its first answer 74.7% of
the time; among the rest it is **more likely to change a correct answer to an
incorrect one** than the reverse. Their diagnosis: *"LLMs cannot properly judge
the correctness of their reasoning."* **This is the sentence our whole design
rests on** — it is a claim about the *judge*, not about the *generator*, which
is exactly why we externalise the judge.

**Two further results, both of which bite on our ablation table:**
- **§4 — multi-agent debate is self-consistency in disguise.** At a matched
  9 model calls: debate **83.0** vs self-consistency **88.2** on GSM8K. The gain
  people attribute to "critique" is really selection across generations.
- **§5 — a prompt-design confound.** Self-Refine's reported gain on
  CommonGen-Hard came partly from stating the requirement *only* in the feedback
  prompt. Putting it in the initial prompt instead: standard **81.8** vs **75.1**
  after self-correction. So "self-correction helped" can just mean "the second
  prompt was more informative than the first".

**They endorse our approach by name (§6, "Leveraging external feedback"):**
*"when valid external feedback is available, it is beneficial to leverage it
properly"*, citing **Cobbe et al. 2021**, Lightman et al. 2023 and Wang et al.
2023b — *"train a verifier or a critique model on a high-quality dataset to
verify or refine LLM outputs"*. That is this thesis, in a low-resource language,
on a generation task. **Huang et al. is not an obstacle we route around; it is
the paper that names our direction as the promising one.**

**How to cite it without overstating (use this wording):**
> Huang et al. (2024) show that *intrinsic* self-correction — without external
> feedback — fails to improve, and often degrades, LLM performance on reasoning
> benchmarks, and attribute this to the model's inability to judge the
> correctness of its own output. This motivates externalising the judge; it does
> not by itself establish that an external verifier helps on persona-controlled
> generation in Bangla, which is what RQ2 tests.

❌ **Do not write** "Huang et al. proved LLMs cannot self-correct, therefore we
use an external verifier." They did not test our setting, and an examiner who
has read the paper will say so.

**Consequences for our design (raised here on 2026-08-01; resolved before
Phase-5 generation on 2026-08-20):**
1. **Inference-cost matching.** §6 asks that self-correction be compared against
   baselines *"with comparable inference costs"*. Our ablation rows 1–3 are
   single-call; rows 4–8 loop. Row 6 beating row 1 may be partly a call-count
   effect. → **decision 9 closed: add realized-compute-matched row 9.**
2. **A self-consistency / best-of-N baseline at matched calls** is the strong
   baseline they demand. → **row 9 now supplies it.**
3. **Prompt parity.** Row 1's zero-shot persona prompt must state the persona
   requirement as fully as the verifier feedback does, or our gain is §5's
   confound wearing our variable names. → **decision 10 closed by the shared
   prompt renderer.**

**Follow-up reading this entry generated:** Cobbe et al. 2021 (already Tier-1 —
now clearly load-bearing, since Huang et al. point at it as the alternative);
Wang et al. 2022 self-consistency (needed for the baseline above); Madaan et al.
2023 Self-Refine (the paper §5 critiques, and the closest thing to our loop
without a trained verifier).

### [~] kamoi2024when — Kamoi et al., TACL 2024
*When Can LLMs Actually Correct Their Own Mistakes? A Critical Survey* · TACL 12: 1417–1440
- **Role:** intrinsic-vs-extrinsic taxonomy — supplies our framing vocabulary.
- **Feeds:** Ch.2 taxonomy paragraph; **Ch.1 gap sentence**; decision 9.
- 🎁 **§5.2: *"Fine-tuning enables self-correction when large training data is
  available but is unexplored for small training data."*** Our verifier trains on
  **R1 = 2,162 rows**. A TACL survey names our exact regime as *unexplored* —
  a gap sentence we do not have to argue for.
- **§5.1:** *"Self-correction is effective in tasks where reliable external
  feedback is available"* — the sentence RQ2 rests on.
- **RQ1 finding:** *no* prior work shows successful correction from **prompted-LLM**
  feedback → predicts our row 7 loses, which is why it is the right baseline.
- **§6 "Strong Baselines":** *"Self-correction is often not compared with
  sufficiently strong baselines"* — independent confirmation of decision 9.
- **Taxonomy (Table 1)** — use this vocabulary: Intrinsic / Oracle /
  Fair-Asymmetric / Unfair-Asymmetric / **Cross-Model**. ⬛ **We must place our
  own system in it before a reviewer does** — REFINER and RL4F (a large LM with a
  trained T5 feedback model) sit under Cross-Model and are the closest structural
  analogue to ours.
- ⬛ **Get their experiment-design checklist and run §5.1 against it before S6.**

### [x] mop2025 — Mixture-of-Personas (arXiv 2504.05019) ⚠️ venue unverified
- **Role:** **closest competitor.** Borrow formalism (population P, K groups,
  persona g_k). Uses IMDB/SST-2 — overlaps our English arm.
- **Feeds:** Ch.2, and the head-to-head comparison table.
- **Numbers to compare:** MAUVE (this is why §C mandates `mauve-text`),
  persona-conditioning accuracy, K selection method.
- **Key question when reading:** how do they *validate* personas? If they do not
  human-validate, that gap is our contribution ①.
- **Notes:**

- **✅ [x] ENTRY COMPLETE (2026-08-01, from the PDF).** Every register field
  below is now filled from §4.1–4.5.
- **✅ Persona validation: NONE.** §4 has only Steerability / Synthetic Data
  Generation / Transferability / Ablations, plus §7 Limitations. No human
  evaluation anywhere. **Contribution ① stands.**
- **✅ K selection: THERE IS NONE. K is fixed at 100 by hand.** §4.1: *"we choose
  the number of personas to be 100 … We then run K-Means and the persona
  synthesizer to extract 100 persona descriptions."* No K-table, no stability
  analysis, no selection criterion. **Our Gate G1 (7 criteria, bootstrap ARI,
  prediction strength) is therefore contribution ②** — and note the conceptual
  gap: they model a population as **100 micro-personas**; we model **3 audience
  types**. Different granularity, and Ch.2 should say so rather than imply we do
  the same thing at different K.
- **✅ Datasets — the pipeline's claim is CONFIRMED:** AGNews (topic) + **Yelp,
  SST-2, IMDB** (sentiment).
- **✅ MAUVE: yes, primary alignment metric**, alongside **FID** and **KL Cosine**
  (their own diversity metric: KL between pairwise-cosine histograms). Encoder
  `all-mpnet-base-v2`; base LLM Llama3-8B-Instruct for MoP *and* all baselines;
  5,000 synthetic responses per method; top M=4 persona–exemplar pairs per input.
  **§C's mandate to use `mauve-text` is justified — the numbers are comparable.**
- **⚠️ Persona-conditioning accuracy: they never measure it.** Alignment is
  distributional (FID / MAUVE / KL Cosine) plus downstream F1. **There is no
  per-persona controllability number in the paper** — which is exactly the axis
  RQ2 measures. Another gap.

**Numbers to compare (Table 1, AGNews / Yelp / SST-2 / IMDB):**

| | FID ↓ | MAUVE ↑ | KL Cosine ↓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| MoP AGNews | **0.951** | **0.871** | 0.069 |
| MoP Yelp | 0.948 | 0.826 | 0.067 |
| MoP SST-2 | 1.131 | 0.855 | 0.319 |
| MoP IMDB | 0.771 | 0.865 | 0.039 |
| best baseline (PICLe/ProGen/AttrPrompt) | 1.769–4.736 | 0.537–0.767 | — |

| MoP improvement | 46–69% | **+13.6% to +41.3%** | 33–80% |

**Table 2 — downstream F1** (DistilBERT trained on 5,000 synthetic samples,
tested on golden test set):

| | AGNews | Yelp | SST-2 | IMDB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Golden data | 0.903 | 0.896 | 0.919 | 0.877 |
| **MoP** | 0.871 | 0.867 | 0.845 | **0.865** |
| AttrPrompt | 0.836 | 0.864 | 0.838 | 0.793 |

**Table 4 — ablation, and this one matters to us:**

| | FID ↓ | MAUVE ↑ | KL Cosine ↓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| MoP | 0.951 | 0.871 | 0.069 |
| **w/o exemplars** | **3.694** | **0.552** | **0.560** |
| w/o persona synthesiser | 1.674 | 0.807 | 0.174 |
| w/ random personas | 1.814 | 0.622 | 0.061 |

🔑 **Removing the exemplars is far more damaging than removing the persona
synthesiser** (MAUVE 0.871 → 0.552 vs → 0.807). **The exemplars carry most of
the benefit, not the persona descriptions.** Since our RAG layer is structurally
their exemplar layer, this predicts our row 3 (RAG only) may beat rows 1–2
(persona prompting) by more than expected — and it is an argument that our
ablation is right to separate them.
- **Transferability (Table 3):** MoP trained on Llama3-8B transfers to
  Gemma2-9B (MAUVE 0.957) and Mistral-7B (0.869) without retraining.
- **Formalism to adopt:** p(y|x) = Σₖ πₖ · p_LM(y|gₖ, x), Σπₖ = 1; plus a second
  level weighting in-context exemplars. Our RAG over R1 ≈ their exemplar level.
- ⚠️ **Venue unverified** — arXiv shows no venue, not "Findings of ACL 2025".
  ⚠️ **"IMDB/SST-2" unverified** — abstract names no dataset.
- ⚠️ **Venue still unverified** — arXiv shows none; the pipeline's "Findings of
  ACL 2025" remains unconfirmed. Everything else in this entry is now filled.

### [x] S5 post-run metric boundary — MAUVE and diversity (2026-08-22)

- **`pillutla2021mauve`:** MAUVE compares two distributions through a
  quantized embedding space. Its implementation accepts precomputed features,
  but its default raw-text pathway is GPT-2-large and its guidance recommends
  a few thousand samples per distribution. Therefore our 270-vs-270
  condition-level comparisons are labelled **LaBSE-feature MAUVE sensitivity
  analyses**, not ordinary/default-GPT2 MAUVE and not comparable to MoP's
  5,000-sample English-encoder values.
- **`shaib2025diversity`:** recent diversity validation finds that combining
  low-correlated measures is preferable to treating a single score as a
  diversity conclusion. Accordingly Self-BLEU is retained beside length
  diagnostics and short-text rate; it is not a standalone realism claim.

### [~] sands2026 — Sands et al., NCAA 2026 (doi 10.1007/s00521-026-12247-0)
- **Role:** English persona-prompted movie reviews. Their gaps = our motivation.
- **Feeds:** Ch.1 §1.1(2), Ch.2, and directly the §5.5 cross-lingual framing.
- **Numbers to compare:** their persona-control reliability on English.
- **Notes:**

- **Their gap is our target:** *"a noticeable gap in emotional richness and
  stylistic coherence"* vs IMDb, despite fluent, structurally complete output.
- **Generator warning:** GPT-4o overemphasises positive emotions; DeepSeek-V3
  most balanced; Gemini-2.0 excessive emotional intensity.
- **Design gap we exploit:** they feed subtitles + screenplays, which exist only
  post-production. Ours is pre-release — synopsis only.

### [~] cobbe2021verifiers — Cobbe et al. 2021
*Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems*
- **Role:** origin of the trained-verifier line; our generate–verify–refine
  ancestor. Establishes that a **separately trained** verifier beats self-scoring.
- **Feeds:** Ch.2 §verifiers, Ch.3 verifier design rationale.
- **Notes:**

- **Load-bearing, not background:** Huang §6 names this as the alternative to
  intrinsic correction.
- **Key claim:** *"verification scales more effectively with increased data than
  a finetuning baseline"* — pre-empts "why not fine-tune the generator?".
- **Honest difference:** their verifier **ranks** (best-of-N); ours **gates and
  refines**. Best-of-N is also the cost-matched baseline decision 9 needs.
- ⬛ Body not read (no arXiv HTML for 2021).
### [x] selfcorrectionillusion2026 — arXiv 2606.05976
*The Self-Correction Illusion: Role Relabeling Gates Explicit Error Flagging in Large Language Models*
- **Role:** why external-role feedback works — the Critic's justification.
- **Read:** full relevant method/results/limitations via the primary v2 PDF on
  2026-08-20; arXiv ID, current title and five authors verified.
- **Notes:**

---

- **Claim:** willingness to correct depends on the chat-template **role label**,
  not the claim's content. Byte-identical claim (SHA-256), only the role varies.
- **Numbers:** +23 to +93 pp; 10/12 cells have a significant relabel, 2
  exceptions have high baselines (L₀ ≥ 67%); 9/12 survive Holm–Bonferroni;
  29/30 per-task flips on
  Llama-70B logic.
- **Mechanism:** bare wrapper 17–23 pp, role tag a further ~30 pp; nonsense
  `<xqzy>` 30% vs `<memory>` 70%; within-thought duplication control only
  +6.7 pp (p=0.26) → +46.7 pp pure role-tag effect.
- 🔴 **Self-distrust control:** telling the agent to verify its own thoughts
  gives 0–23% vs 70% for the relabel. **Naive self-distrust is not a
  substitute** — which is why our row 7 should lose, mechanistically.
- ⚠️ **Scope:** measured on a *failure pool* (tasks where intrinsic correction
  already failed), so lifts are on a pre-selected subset.
- → **decision 11 CLOSED:** row 7b is a main byte-identical `user`-role control.
- **Gemma-3 implementation constraint (v2 Appendix E):** its native template
  exposes only alternating user/model turns. This changed our invalid
  consecutive-user construction to a shared `user → assistant → user` topology;
  the critique bytes move between the assistant and final user content.

### [x] verma2026blindresampling — arXiv 2607.26117
*Try Again, Don't Look Back: Blind Resampling Outperforms Self-Repair in Small
Code Models*
- **Role:** strongest recent argument for Phase-5 decision 9.
- **Read:** method, results, cost analysis and limitations from the primary PDF,
  2026-08-20.
- Four matched-retry arms isolate blind resampling, self-exposure placebo,
  execution feedback, and reflection on MBPP+ at 1.5B/3B/7B. Blind resampling
  wins below 7B and ties the best 7B arm while using fewer output tokens.
- **Design consequence:** comparison against one-shot cannot identify feedback
  value. Row 9 must use fresh samples and preserve the full nested budget curve.
- **Transfer bound:** code has executable pass/fail and the studied models are
  small; this motivates the control but does not predict the Bangla result.

### [x] bilal2026refining — arXiv 2608.05643
*Refining Over Resampling: Test-Time Self-Correction for LLM Reasoning*
- **Role:** recent counterweight to a blanket "resampling always wins" claim.
- **Read:** method, baselines, compute accounting, results and limitations from
  the primary PDF, 2026-08-20.
- Breadth–depth refinement beats several N=8 sampling/selection baselines on
  mathematical reasoning in the reported experiments. Crucially, the authors
  state that the main comparison fixes sample count, **not total TFLOPs**, and
  is not a direct equal-budget comparison.
- **Design consequence:** report both quality and realized compute; do not use
  this paper to assume which Phase-5 arm will win. Open-ended controlled text is
  outside its evaluated scope.

### 5a — Experimental methodology: seeds, variance, model comparison

| Key | Source | What it is used for | Read |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bethard2022seeds` | Bethard 2022, arXiv (22 cit.) | 🔴 **Load-bearing.** Names "vary only the seed to build score distributions for performance comparison" a **risky** use, and sensitivity measurement a **safe** one. This is why S3.2's winner is decided by paired bootstrap, not by best mean ± SD. **It contradicted our own protocol of 2026-08-07.** | `[ ]` |
| `gundersen2023conclusions` | Gundersen et al. 2023, ACM REP (16 cit.) | Small effect sizes + few repetitions → wrong conclusions. Supports 5 seeds over 3. | `[ ]` |
| `casola2022transformers` | Casola et al. 2022, *Machine Learning with Applications* (66 cit.) | Only ~20% of transformer papers report multiple runs; low robustness to seed and hyperparameters. | `[ ]` |
| `coakley2022implementation` | Coakley et al. 2022, IEEE e-Science (4 cit.) | 🔴 **Load-bearing, three times over.** 780 runs across 13 hardware and 4 software environments; **>6 pp** accuracy range from environment alone. Justifies discarding attempt 1, pinning the environment, gating checkpoint resume, and the Ch.4 claim that our 3.5 pp spread is below measurement resolution. | `[ ]` |
| `teodorescu2025kfold` | Teodorescu et al. 2025, *Computers* (61 cit.) | k-fold selection is valid within a model class, unreliable **across** classes. Our seven arms span three. Ch.5 limitation. | `[ ]` |
| `fu2023stability` | Fu et al. 2023, arXiv (4 cit.) | Theoretical stability bound for full fine-tuning vs head tuning — the mechanism behind the instability we are guarding against at n=804. | `[ ]` |
| `xue2023reproducibility` | Xue et al. 2023, venue ⚠️ unverified (3 cit.) | **Cited as a rejected alternative.** Recommends blocked 3×2 CV over repeated standard splits on SNR grounds; rejected 2026-08-08 because it re-draws the train/dev boundary inside R1. Must be represented fairly, which means reading it. | `[ ]` |

### 5b — Small-n classification: the two added arms

| Key | Source | What it is used for | Read |
|---|---|---|---|
| `laurer2023bertnli` | Laurer et al. 2023, *Political Analysis* (266 cit.) | 🔴 **Load-bearing.** +10.7–18.3 pp over classical models at 100–2,500 training texts, *particularly on imbalanced data*. Sole justification for adding the BERT-NLI arm. Our case: 804 rows, ~40% minority. | `[ ]` |
| `tunstall2022setfit` | Tunstall et al. 2022, arXiv (312 cit.) | The SetFit method itself — prompt-free contrastive fine-tuning of a Sentence Transformer. Our LaBSE body is already in the pipeline. | `[ ]` |
| `beliveau2024smalldata` | Beliveau et al. 2024, arXiv (2 cit.) | 🔴 **Load-bearing.** Closest published setting to ours — non-English, small, imbalanced, domain-specific — and finds **BERT-like > SetFit > LLM**. Sole basis for pre-registering SetFit as an *expected loser*, which is what makes either S3.2 outcome informative. | `[ ]` |
| `bucher2024finetuned` | Bucher et al. 2024, arXiv (122 cit.) | Fine-tuned small models beat zero-shot generative models in classification. Supporting, not load-bearing. | `[ ]` |

### 5c — Calibration at small n

| Key | Source | What it is used for | Read |
|---|---|---|---|
| `balanya2022adaptivetemp` | Balanya et al. 2022, *Neural Computing and Applications* (73 cit.) | Expressive calibrators fail under data scarcity; simple scaling stays robust. Why S3.4 **keeps** plain temperature scaling rather than upgrading it. | `[ ]` |
| `guo2025smart` | Guo et al. 2025, arXiv (2 cit.) | Cited **only** for its statement of the bias/variance dilemma under insufficient validation data. We do not adopt SMART. | `[ ]` |

### 5d — The Bangla backbone disagreement

> **These six are cited together and only together.** Individually each looks
> like a result; together they are the argument. Two of them (`hassin2026`,
> `mazumder2025`) use the **same BanglaBlend dataset** and report a **different
> ordering**. That is the point: "BanglaBERT because it is Bangla-native" cannot
> be defended by citation, so the S3.2 ablation has to do the work.
>
> ⚠️ **Citation-count health check, stated rather than hidden:** four of these
> six have **0 citations** and are 2025–2026 conference papers. They are
> adequate as evidence that *the field disagrees* — a disagreement needs only
> that the claims were made and published. They are **not** adequate as evidence
> that any particular model is best, and none is used that way.

| Key | Reported winner | Dataset / n | Cit. | Read |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `hasan2025banglaemotion` | BanglaBERT (0.83) | Bangla emotion, 7,200 | 1 | `[ ]` |
| `hasan2023banglawar` | BanglaBERT (86%) | Bangla sentiment, 10,861 | 41 | `[ ]` |
| `mitra2025muril` | **MuRIL** (92%) — beats both | Bangla emotion | 0 | `[ ]` |
| `hassin2026banglablend` | **XLM-R** (94%) > BanglaBERT (93.4%) | **BanglaBlend, 7,350** | 0 | `[ ]` |
| `mazumder2025banglaforms` | **IndicBERTv2** (95.44%) > XLM-R > BanglaBERT | **BanglaBlend — same data** | 0 | `[ ]` |
| `mukherjee2023blp` | XLM-R > BanglaBERT | BLP-2023 shared task | 0 | `[ ]` |

⚠️ `mukherjee2023blp` ranked **19th of 30** in that shared task. It is evidence
that the ordering is unstable across teams, **not** evidence that XLM-R is
better, and it is never to be cited as the latter.

`hasan2025banglaemotion` additionally supplies the **methodological precedent**
for our decision rule: it settles the same comparison in the same language with
a **paired bootstrap test**.

## Tier 6 — Clusterability and post-clustering inference (added 2026-08-10)

> **Why this tier exists.** Everything above defends *how* we clustered. Nothing
> defended the prior question — **whether this data clusters at all** — and G1's
> own diagnostics (silhouette 0.053, monotone gap statistic, HDBSCAN 100% noise)
> had been answering "no" since 2026-08-03 without a literature to read it
> against. These four entries supply it, and they closed STATUS decision 12.
>
> **Source disclosure:** found via alphaXiv and Scite on 2026-08-10, **not
> Consensus** — the Consensus quota was exhausted (0 searches until 1 September).
> The standing instruction prefers Consensus; it was unavailable, this is
> recorded rather than glossed, and the searches were re-run across two indices
> to compensate for using neither the preferred one nor a single one.

| `pinto2026drawinglines` | Pinto, Marques & Lopez 2026, arXiv 2605.06989 | `[x]` abstract + full body via PDF query | 🔴 **LOAD-BEARING — this is the paper that retired both *persona* and *cluster*.** k-means on simulated data with no latent groups, and on 8,360 real psychometric respondents. Empirical result: **k = 2, silhouette ≈ 0.31, ARI 0.999 ± 0.001, sizes 50.6/49.4** — numerically almost our region B (49.4/50.6, silhouette 0.039, bootstrap ARI 0.962). Their reading of it: *"geometric stratifications of a latent psychological continuum rather than evidence for discrete subtypes"*, and **"Stability, therefore, is not equivalent to validity."** On correlated Gaussian data: ARI = 1.00, SD 0.00, described as *"an artificial partition of a continuous, anisotropic distribution."* **Our PS ≥ 0.80 rule passing a contentless cut in region B is this phenomenon, not a quirk of our pipeline.** |
| `cornelissen2026contour` | Cornelissen, Zuidema, Burgoyne & Honing 2026, arXiv 2604.13119 | `[x]` full body via PDF query | **Precedent that a negative clusterability result is publishable**, across three musical traditions, using dist-dip after UMAP. Also the sharpest cautionary case in either paper: with no clustering present, k-means places centroids near the leading principal axes, reproducing a previously *published* four-type typology *"for entirely mathematical, not musical reasons."* Conclusion: treat the character as **continuous**. Direct model for how our Ch.4 should report the K = 2 cut. |
| `chen2023selectiveinference` | Chen & Witten 2023, *JMLR* 24 | `[ ]` — cited via `pinto2026drawinglines`; **must be read before Ch.4 is written** | 🔴 **Forces a Ch.5 limitation (deviation of 2026-08-10).** Classical post-hoc tests on cluster-derived groups inflate Type I error, because the same data defines and tests the groups — and large between-group differences appear **even when no population categories exist**. S2e/S2f's φ = 0.3981, χ² = 300.7 and surface AUCs are all post-clustering inference on the defining rows. **They are demoted to descriptive profiling; no p-value from them is evidence.** RQ1-H is untouched — held-out items, annotators blind to the partition. |
| `adolfsson2019clusterability` | Adolfsson, Ackerman & Brownstein 2019, *Pattern Recognition* 88 | `[ ]` | Survey of clusterability methods — the question G1 asked informally and answered with three ad-hoc indicators. Provides the vocabulary (*clusterability*) and the formal tests. |
| `vonluxburg2010stability` | von Luxburg 2010, arXiv 1007.1075 | `[ ]` | **The foundational critique of stability-based K selection — i.e. of our own PS ≥ 0.80 rule.** RQ1-G rediscovered its central warning independently (region B: PS 0.818 on a cut correlating with nothing). Citing it converts an odd finding into a confirmed known failure mode. |
| `kalogeratos2012distdip` | Kalogeratos & Likas 2012 | `[ ]` | The dist-dip multimodality test, via `cornelissen2026contour`. **Candidate addition to Ch.4** — a direct clusterability test we never ran; cheaper than anything in G1 and it answers the question G1 only circled. |

⚠️ **Two of these are not yet read in full** (`chen2023selectiveinference`,
`vonluxburg2010stability`) and both are load-bearing. They carry the same
warning as Tier 5: listed because `protocol.md` now rests on them, and an
unread load-bearing citation is a debt, not an asset.

## Tier 7 — Verifier gaming and evaluator independence (added 2026-08-11)

> **Why this tier exists.** RQ5 rests on two assumptions that had never been
> checked against the literature: that **Verifier-A and Verifier-B are
> independent enough** for their gap to mean something, and — proposed on
> 2026-08-11 — that a **symbolic scorer resists gaming**. The first is weaker
> than decision 16 claimed. The second is false. Both were settled *before*
> anything was written, which is the standing instruction working.

| `mahmoud2026rubric` | Mahmoud et al. 2026, arXiv 2605.12474 (Scale AI) | `[x]` **full body** | 🔴 **Cited twice, for opposite purposes.** (1) It is decision 16's basis for cross-family evaluation. (2) **It refutes the RQ3 gaming-shield reframing before it was written.** Rule-based rewards *are* hacked: under a strong verifier, rubric judges preferred the checkpoint on **85.8%** of prompts while rubric-free judges preferred the **base** on **78.4%**; gains concentrated in **presence-based** criteria (+1.07 completeness) with losses in conciseness (−2.91), relevance (−1.10), factual correctness (−0.85). Mechanism: *"hacking the rubric, not the verifier."* **Our §3.5 features are presence/count-based and our Reflector names the failing rule to the Writer** — strictly easier to game than their setting. ⬛ Their `self-internalization gap` diagnostic is **not usable here**: it needs a training trajectory, and we never fine-tune (rule 10). |
| `kuai2026entanglement` | Kuai et al. 2026, arXiv 2604.07650 (Texas A&M) | `[x]` **full body** | 🔴 **Amends decision 16.** 18 LLMs × 6 families: entanglement is widespread **intra- and cross-family**, so "different family" does not establish independence. *"Apparent agreement may reflect a consensus of correlated errors rather than independent verification."* Tracks judge over-endorsement (Spearman **0.64**, p<0.001). **Plain correlation fails to detect it** — the signal is in the joint **failure** manifold (BEI, CIG), weighted toward co-failures on easy items. Supplies the dev-slice entanglement audit now pre-registered for RQ5. |

## Tier 8 — Sentence specificity: the construct has prior art (added 2026-08-11)

> **The most consequential thing this tier does is remove an invention.** RQ1's
> construct was treated throughout as something the project defined. It is a
> **named task with a fifteen-year literature**, and one of its papers evaluates
> on **movie reviews**. That changes Ch.2: the construct is *adopted*, not coined.

| `ko2019specificity` | Ko, Durrett & Li, AAAI 2019 | `[x]` **full body** | 🔴 **The S3.5 feature pool comes from here, replacing the pipeline's presence-based list.** Validated families: normalised punctuation/digits, mean word length, discourse connectives, sentiment-bearing fraction, and — decisively — **min/max/mean IDF**, the one family that cannot be satisfied vacuously. Evaluates on **movie reviews**: Spearman **0.702** vs a **length baseline of 0.581**, which independently reproduces our `length_auc` **0.6764**. ⚠️ Also reframes G-300 attempt 1: their α of 0.68–0.70 needed **9 raters plus exclusion of raters below 0.3**. We had **2** and no exclusion rule — a second cause of α 0.4970 beside scale collapse. |
| `kapur2026length` | Kapur, Hawkins & Kreiss 2026, arXiv 2601.04609 (Stanford/UCLA) | `[x]` **full body** | Independent support for **RQ1-H's length-matched design** — with length held constant, humans reliably prefer the more specific option. 🔴 **Forces the hybrid-weight relocation:** in *human* text longer means more specific; in **machine-generated text the relation is flat or reversed**, so a weight calibrated on real reviews will not transfer to generated ones. Their contrast-set specificity measure is also robust to fabricated detail (rank 17.05 → 30.91) — a **candidate for §5.4's realism test, not yet adopted**. |

**The honest asymmetry, recorded because it is the argument for both rows:**
these papers study policies trained by RL against a reward. **We never train a
generator** (rule 10) — our loop reruns a *prompted* model up to three times.
So the optimisation pressure is far weaker than theirs, and their effect sizes
are an **upper bound** on what our loop could produce, not a prediction. That
cuts both ways: it makes gaming less likely *and* makes a null RQ5 result less
informative. Both halves go in Ch.5.

## Tier 9 — Not tuning, and not assuming calibration (added 2026-08-11)

> **Both entries were found by a search run *before* the decision they inform,
> and both changed something.** One fixed a hyperparameter rule; the other
> deleted a sentence from `protocol.md` that had been written from memory the
> previous day. ⚠️ **Index used: alphaXiv, not Consensus** — the Consensus quota
> is exhausted until 1 September 2026. Recorded rather than glossed over,
> because "searched a different index" and "did not search" must not look alike

Reanalysis of seven HPO benchmark suites: in **~10% of runs the validation-optimal configuration generalises *worse* than the default**, and their mixed models name the aggravating conditions as **small data, holdout rather than CV, binary classification, accuracy-type metric** — all four describe Verifier-B (888 rows, 82-row holdout, 2 classes, macro-F1). Their own recommendation is repeated CV; **not tuning at all was available and is strictly stronger**, so it was taken. Also the standing citation for why the 82-row dev slice is a *reporting* surface and never a selection surface. |
| `zhang2026tabpfn` | Zhang et al. 2026, arXiv 2607.11007 (USC) | `[x]` **full body** | 🔴 **Withdraws the "natively calibrated" defence of Verifier-A and makes §3.4 temperature scaling mandatory for it.** Across **22,820 episodes**, 14 datasets and 11 encoders, a logistic head on a frozen encoder takes the **best mean rank on accuracy** and ranks **below kNN and every in-context head on both ECE and NLL** (Top-1 ECE **0.069** vs 0.037 / 0.031). Their sentence, which is the one that matters: *"strong accuracy does not inherently guarantee well-calibrated probabilities."* ✅ **What survives:** their practical guidance keeps logistic regression appropriate for *"high dimensions, or near-ceiling tasks"* — ours is 768-d LaBSE at 0.9866 — so **the artifact is confirmed and one sentence of its justification is not.** ⚠️ **Bounded:** their canonical grid is 10-class and the calibration gap narrows at C=2; our task is binary, so the recorded correction is *"the claim had no support"*, not *"Verifier-A is miscalibrated"*. |

**Why this tier is one line longer than it needs to be.** `zhang2026tabpfn` is
the **fourth** entry in CLAUDE.md's table of decisions made without searching
first, and the cheapest to have caught — the claim was one day old and no code
depended on it. The three earlier entries each cost a rebuilt instrument, a
rewritten decision rule, or a withdrawn recommendation. **The table is kept
because the pattern is the argument for the rule, not because the failures are
interesting individually.**

## Tier 10 — Threshold scoping and generator selection (added 2026-08-11, for Phase 4)

> **All six were found by a search run *before* the decision they inform, and
> the first two changed a recommendation Claude had already made to Sabbir.**
> ⚠️ **Index used: alphaXiv, not Consensus** — quota exhausted until
> 1 September 2026, recorded for the reason Tier 9 gives.
>
> 🔴 **READING DEPTH, STATED UP FRONT BECAUSE IT IS SHALLOW: abstracts only, all
> six.** None is briefed to `base_papers_brief.md` depth. Where a claim in
> `protocol.md` §S4 rests on one of these, it rests on an abstract. That is a

| `axiv2607_24562_hierarchicalcrc` | arXiv 2607.24562, 2026-07-27 | `[x]` **HTML method read 2026-08-18** | 🔴 **CORRECTION:** this paper does **not** define variance-ratio partial pooling. HG-CRC uses Bonferroni-corrected node certification and a **leaf-first fallback** to a coarser certified threshold. The earlier abstract-only note attributed an estimator the paper does not contain. Its heterogeneity warning still supports reporting per-level frontiers, but its method is not adopted: our objective is quality per LLM call, not conformal risk under a fixed error budget, and 30 cases per level cannot support the claimed certification. |
| `axiv2605_14260_fairnessburden` | arXiv 2605.14260, 2026-05-14 | `[~]` **abstract only** | 🔴 **The fifth entry in CLAUDE.md's search-first table — it refuted a recommendation Claude had already given Sabbir.** Claude had recommended a single global τ *as the conservative option*. The paper states that a single pooled threshold "can hide cross-group heterogeneity in score distributions and distort group-wise coverage". ⚠️ Its title also names the constraint on the other side — group-conditional thresholds **cost calibration sample**, and we have 30 dev-plots per level — which is precisely why the answer is partial pooling rather than a straight switch to per-level τ. |
| `axiv2605_05562_socioconformal` | arXiv 2605.05562, 2026-05-07 | `[~]` **abstract only** | Corroborates the row above from a different domain (ordinal conformal prediction on complex survey data); its title *is* the argument — *marginal validity is not enough for subgroup reliability*. **Cited as convergent, not independent, evidence** — the same claim in another field, not a second measurement of ours. |
| `axiv2606_29403_selforganizedcp` | arXiv 2606.29403, 2026-06-28 | `[~]` **abstract only** | Third reproduction of the pooled-calibration failure — "pooled calibration averages over heterogeneous regions and can mask regional undercoverage". Included so decision 2 rests on a **field** rather than on one paper, per CLAUDE.md's search mechanics: one 10-result call is not "the search". |

| `axiv2605_31483_benhallueval` | arXiv 2605.31483, 2026-05-29 | `[~]` **abstract only** | First systematic Bengali hallucination evaluation of LLMs. **Registers Bangla generation quality as a documented risk before the Writer produces a single review**, rather than as an assumption. 🎁 Its framing — *no prior work has systematically evaluated hallucination in LLMs for Bengali, despite Bengali being the sixth most spoken language* — is independent 2026 support for the low-resource gap Ch.1 claims. |
| `axiv2605_22487_banglahonorific` | arXiv 2605.22487, 2026-05-21 | `[~]` **abstract only** | 🔑 **The one with a direct line to our construct.** Honorifics and register are not garnish in Bangla, and the engagement-specificity axis is partly a register distinction — S2b's probe separated the two corpora on first-person pronouns, exclamation and comma-runs. **A generator that mishandles Bangla honorifics fails on the dimension the Critic scores.** ⚠️ Flagged for §4.6: the pre-specified failure taxonomy is *wrong sentiment / too short / off-topic / template repeat* and has **no register or honorific category at all**. |

### Tier 10b — Prompt parity and the failure taxonomy (added 2026-08-11, same pass)

Cited beside `huang2024selfcorrect` as evidence that apparent self-correction gains are **routinely measurement artefacts** — the argument for closing prompt parity **by construction** (§S4 decision 5) rather than by audit. |
| `axiv2604_22273_scfeedbackcontrol` | Liu & Meng, arXiv 2604.22273, 2026-04-24 | `[x]` **full body, 2026-08-20** | Recasts **intrinsic**, same-model refinement on binary-correctness reasoning tasks as feedback control. Its EIR/ECR analysis reinforces that repeated correction can degrade, but its near-zero-EIR threshold is **not transferred** to our external-verifier, graded open-text setting; the paper itself names external feedback and open-ended correctness as future scope. It therefore forces per-iteration improve/worsen reporting, not a new stopping threshold. |

Forces §S4 decision 6. |
| `axiv2606_10765_arabigee` | arXiv 2606.10765, 2026-06-09 | `[~]` **abstract only** | Precedent for a **language-specific hierarchical error taxonomy** in a non-English language — evidence that extending §4.6's list for Bangla is normal practice, not an ad hoc departure. |
| `axiv2608_03966_hallutruthqa` | arXiv 2608.03966, 2026-08-04 | `[~]` **abstract only** | Comparable low-resource resources *"often assign a binary label"*; fine-grained is the improvement. Supports a multi-category taxonomy with a **reported `other` rate** over pass/fail coding. |

> Search ran before changing the Critic. Consensus remained unavailable until
> 2026-09-01; primary arXiv records were used. These are abstract-level reads.

| `wang2026nlhf` | Wang et al., ICML 2026, arXiv 2601.07349 | A binary outcome can be correct while the critique is unsound; process-level natural-language feedback supplies information that outcome labels omit. Supports retaining failed-rule traces. |
| `anugraha2026mr3` | Anugraha et al., ICLR 2026, arXiv 2510.01146 | English LLM-judge performance does not reliably generalise to non-English evaluation. Argues against replacing the Bangla-specific verifier/diagnostic path with a convenient English judge. |

|---|---|---|---|
| `kiecker2026magicnumber` | Kiecker et al., arXiv 2607.05197 | `[~]` abstract + primary record | Across externally validated software-repair tasks, the first 3–4 repairs capture most gains and later returns are marginal. This supports treating retry budget as measured, but compiler/test feedback and up to ten code repairs do not identify the right cutoff for Bangla audience comments. |
| `kim2026judgeutility` | Kim, arXiv 2607.13347 | `[~]` abstract + primary record | A judge may evaluate yet fail to select the best revision; mean neutrality can hide severe per-item regressions. Forces A↔B direction tables and a clearly post-hoc independent-B oracle-headroom diagnostic, while Verifier-B remains outside the loop. |
| `wu2026textualrelaxation` | Wu et al., arXiv 2607.22653 | `[~]` abstract + primary record | Recursive text revisions show large early edits and later soft fixed points. Motivates reporting normalized edit magnitude and word-count movement. Its .02/.03 convergence thresholds come from research abstracts and are not transferred to our three-step Bangla traces. |

## Tier 10e — Phase-5 runner contracts (added 2026-08-20)

> Searched before freezing the implementation details. Consensus remained
> unavailable until 2026-09-01, so the recent-first search used alphaXiv and
> was checked against the primary ACL/arXiv records. Provider capabilities were
> checked only in Google's official documentation.

|---|---|---|---|
| `zhang2025genicldemo` | Zhang et al., Findings of ACL 2025, 2025.findings-acl.592 | `[x]` primary ACL record + paper | Demonstration selection is a material in-context-learning treatment, not harmless plumbing. Forces row 2's selection schedule to be pre-declared and forbids learned/query-specific selection, which would be retrieval and collapse row 2 into row 3. |
| `kim2026judgeutility` | Kim, arXiv 2607.13347 | `[~]` abstract + primary record | A judge that evaluates well need not provide a useful closed-loop optimization signal. Forces row 8 to archive both verdict and feedback, retain an explicit all-fail selection rule, and leave final outcome scoring to Verifier-B. |
| `li2025instance` | Li et al., Findings of EMNLP 2025, 2025.findings-emnlp.182 | `[x]` primary ACL record + method/results | 🔴 Supersedes the same-day globally fixed row-2 draw before generation. Fixed random-factor settings can synchronously bias all instances; instance-level randomization reduces variance and achieved comparable robustness at under half the compute in their benchmarks. Our schedule therefore randomizes examples deterministically per plot/level/replicate while remaining query- and outcome-blind. |
| `cegin2025randomselection` | Cegin et al., Findings of EMNLP 2025, 2025.findings-emnlp.296 | `[x]` primary ACL record + paper | Across low-resource text-augmentation settings, informed selectors only seldom beat random selection and gains are marginal; random selection is the recommended default. Supports random stratified draws rather than adding another learned/similarity selector that would blur row 2 with RAG. |

**What the search changed.** Static examples first became a frozen experimental
treatment rather than a convenience selected by the runner; the second pass
then changed one global fixed draw into a frozen instance-randomized schedule.
The LLM judge got
a validated schema and all-fail policy rather than free-form prose. Bethard's
already-recorded warning also changed the old “mean±SD over seeds” sentence:
three replicates remain as sensitivity/blocking, not as the inferential sample
or a best-seed selection surface.

### Tier 10f — Hosted-judge replacement after the quota stop (added 2026-08-21)

> Consensus remained unavailable until 2026-09-01, so the recent-first search
> used alphaXiv and then read the primary paper text. The search materially

| `pombal2026selfpreference` | Pombal, Rei & Martins, COLM 2026 / arXiv 2604.06996 | `[x]` primary paper | Rubric-based judges can favor their own outputs and outputs from their model family; the paper reports family-level effects for Gemma. Forces the label “hosted cross-generation same-family judge,” forbids an independence claim, and keeps Verifier-B as the sole final outcome scorer. |
| `fu2025multilingualjudge` | Fu & Liu, Findings of EMNLP 2025 | `[x]` primary paper | Across 25 languages, LLM-judge consistency varies substantially and is particularly poor in lower-resource languages.

| `ponce2026basquejudge` | Ponce et al., LREC 2026 | `[x]` primary paper | In a low-resource Basque case study, state-of-the-art LLM judges correlate poorly with humans and with one another. Confirms the same limitation from a targeted low-resource setting and supports retaining the sealed task-trained Verifier-B for final S6 scoring. |

**Provider evidence.** Google's official Gemma API guide lists
`gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`; the Interactions reference lists the same model and
structured-output interface; the pricing page lists Gemma 4 input/output as
free with no paid token tier. These are capability/lifecycle sources, not
method citations.

## Tier 10 — S5 human-evaluation design (added 2026-08-23)

> **Search record.** Consensus was searched first with eight narrow queries over
> sampling, rater allocation, forced choice, pairwise evaluation and agreement,
> targeting 2025--2026 before widening one allocation query to 2024. Load-bearing
> papers were then read through alphaXiv. This search changed the interface: the

But metric-based selection can unfairly disadvantage evaluated model families. Because our human test validates Verifier-B, sampling on A/B would condition the validation set on its evaluators; forces outcome-blind balanced selection while minimizing duplicate exposure. |

| `james2026agreement` | James, arXiv 2603.06865 | `[x]` metric table and interpretation sections | For three nominal raters, Fleiss kappa assumes complete equal ratings and is imbalance-sensitive; nominal Krippendorff alpha supports 2+ raters and missingness. Forces CI and disagreement-pattern reporting and forbids treating a universal agreement cutoff as construct validity. |
| `belz2025heds3` | Belz & Thomson, GEM 2025 | `[x]` paper/record | HEDS 3.0 requires the instrument, interface, recruitment, allocation and analysis choices to be documented consistently.

| `lappas2026syntheticaudiences` | Lappas & Filippas, IEEE Access 2026 | `[x]` Consensus full record | Systematic review of synthetic audiences. Its catalogue of hallucination, bias, prompt sensitivity and anthropomorphic overgeneralization confirms that this thesis must describe its output as axis-level-conditioned response generation, not a substitute for real viewers or film-level audience prediction. |

## Gap table — the sentence Ch.2 must end with

Fill as entries complete. The claim we must be able to defend is:
*persona generation (MoP), classifier gating (FUDGE/detox line), and refinement
loops (math/code) exist in separate literatures; no work joins them in a
low-resource language.*

| Work | Persona generation | Trained external verifier | Refine loop | Low-resource lang | Human-validated personas |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MoP (2025) | ✓ | | | | ? |
| Sands et al. (2026) | ✓ | | | | |
| Cobbe et al. (2021) | | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| FUDGE line | | ✓ (gate) | | | |
| **This work** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

⚠️ The empty cells are claims. Each must be verified by actually reading the
paper before the table enters the thesis — an unverified "no one has done this"
is the fastest way to lose a reviewer.
# Post-run plot-faithfulness audit (2026-08-23)

Consensus-first review added a separate plot-faithfulness measurement rather
than treating axis controllability as evidence of factual consistency.
RAGEval separates hallucination and irrelevance from completeness
[@zhu2024rageval], while Rahman et al.'s recent review warns that automatic
factuality metrics remain limited and depend on validated evidence
[@rahman2025hallucination]. This changed the interface design: it now carries a
visible “not independently validated” state, and the proposed human audit is a
separate frozen-output post-run analysis rather than a generation rerun or an
addition to the human instrument already in progress.

The 2026-08-23 interface revision narrowed the automated claim after three
Consensus queries. Papageorgiou et al. support source-aware statement-level
checking rather than an unexplained aggregate badge
[@papageorgiou2025agenticfaithfulness]. Ramprasad and Wallace show that current
automatic factuality metrics degrade on hard cases, can react more strongly to
benign edits than factual corrections, and can be gamed
[@ramprasad2024factualitymetrics]. Consequently the live interface reports a
structured `SUPPORTED` / `REVIEW` / `UNSUPPORTED` operational verdict, its
source-grounded explanation and any unsupported claims; it does **not** call
the score human-validated, does not feed it into generation, and does not add it
to the frozen S5 results. This search changed the design from the user's
requested generic “faithfulness verification” into an inspectable triage check.
## 2026-08-23 — Final thesis `b`-key literature audit

The thesis-facing bibliography is now `docs/references_ieee.bib`; its 143 stable
keys render numerically under IEEE style. The 55 chapter-cited records and
all legacy-key links are recorded in `docs/reference_key_map_full.csv`. The older `docs/references.bib`
remains the research-stage audit trail, not the final render source.

| Keys | Literature line | What the audit establishes |
|---|---|---|
| `b1` | synthetic-audience systematic review | synthetic-user claims require validity boundaries |
| `b2`–`b4` | BanglaBERT, LaBSE, and the Mendeley V3 dataset | primary model and dataset identities |
| `b5`–`b6`, `b13`–`b18` | self-correction, refinement, resampling, and feedback control | motivates separated feedback, role controls, matched compute, and attempt reporting |
| `b7` | Evaluator Stress Tests | supports proxy-gaming diagnostics, not treating Verifier-B as truth |
| `b8` | RAG | foundational retrieval method; not itself the proposed bounded retry architecture |
| `b9`–`b10` | MoP and SimAB | synthetic-population adjacency and its validity boundary |
| `b11`–`b12` | classifier-guided generation and generated movie reviews | controlled-generation and application-domain precedents |
| `b19`–`b21` | Bangla hybrid RAG, symbolic diagnosis, and bounded multi-agent comparison | nearest architectural adjacencies and their transfer limits |
| `b22`–`b25` | judge replacement, self-preference, multilingual judging, and low-resource judging | keeps the hosted judge treatment-side rather than an outcome oracle |
| `b26`–`b28` | recent Bangla backbone comparisons | shows task-dependent winners and blocks a generic BanglaBERT-superiority claim |
| `b29`–`b37` | comparative annotation, HEDS, item selection, rater allocation/modeling, and agreement | supports the two human instruments and their reporting boundaries |
| `b38`–`b45` | prediction strength, ARI, gap, HDBSCAN method/software, silhouette, and AC1 interpretation | clusterability and agreement diagnostics; no single metric becomes construct validity |
| `b46`–`b48` | randomness and fine-tuning stability | supports multi-seed sensitivity without treating seeds as independent studies |
| `b49`–`b50` | paired NLP significance testing and BH | paired inference and multiplicity reporting |
| `b51`–`b52` | small-data transfer and discriminative classification | justifies trained verifier baselines alongside generative judges |
| `b53`–`b54` | temperature scaling and calibration under scarcity | calibration method and bounded small-dev interpretation |
| `b55` | MAUVE | distributional sensitivity and its feature/sample limitations |

**Search effect.** AlphaXiv discovery added HybridRAG-BN, SymDiag, SimAB and
the equal-token resampling study to the final related-work comparison. It also
resolved all five authors of arXiv 2602.08033. The exact-title resolver exposed
two metadata hazards: it did not index the Lappas–Filippas IEEE paper under its
title, and its PDF response for arXiv 2507.05619 reflected a stale version.
Those two records were closed against DOI/DBLP and the ACL Anthology primary
record respectively, rather than trusting the first resolver output.

**Consolidation correction.** The initial audit stopped at 29 chapter-cited
records and therefore understated the available literature. The corrected and
subsequently extended build contains 143 unique records: 55 cited by the active
seven chapters and 88 retained as an uncited research library. Stable `b` keys
and legacy links are preserved, author and publisher metadata corrections are
recorded in the CSV audit map, and internal discovery/read notes remain outside
submission BibTeX.
# Thesis-wide literature audit additions (2026-08-23)

## Multi-agent decomposition requires a bounded claim

- **Saleh et al. (2026), “The Illusion of Agentic Complexity in README.md
  Generation.”** Full text checked through alphaXiv. In a controlled
  repository-documentation task, a specialized multi-agent RAG workflow
  improved structural consistency but did not beat a simpler single-agent
  pipeline on lexical quality and incurred substantially greater token cost.
  This changed the thesis wording: Chapter 5 now defines the implementation as
  a bounded multi-agent workflow, identifies which roles actually call a model,
  and explicitly says the experiment does not prove that role decomposition
  itself is superior. arXiv:2606.30524.
# Dataset citation closure (2026-08-23)

## Preservation infrastructure check (2026-09-09)

- **Klonoff et al. (2026), Research Code Sharing in Support of Gold Standard
  Science**, Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, 20, 609–619.
  Two Consensus queries targeted 2025–2026: research-software archival
  dependencies/data/code preservation, and machine-learning artifact/model/
  environment preservation. The fetched paper record supports pairing
  versioned code with cited data snapshots and environment-specific releases.
  It confirmed the backup design; it did not alter the thesis method. Only the
  paper record/abstract was checked, not a claimed full-text reading.
  https://consensus.app/papers/details/4152944036f555fa8afe496e81cbf2a7/

- **Hossain et al. (2026), Raw Bangla Movie Review Comment Dataset for
  Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing.** Researcher-confirmed
  Mendeley Data V3 record, DOI `10.17632/vwp7gnj3d6.3`. This is the formal
  citation for the primary 5,000-row review resource; the local workbook hash
  remains the authority for the exact bytes and row identities used.
