# Stable IEEE bibliography-key map

The final consolidated bibliography is `docs/references_ieee.bib`. Source prose
uses `b1`, `b2`, ... as stable BibTeX keys. IEEE rendering converts these to
numeric citations such as `[1]` and `[2]`; the letter `b` is not printed.

> **SUPERSEDED SNAPSHOT.** This page preserves the earlier 29-source core audit

This page documents the historical 29 chapter-cited core records in readable form. The
complete machine-auditable map for **all 143 records (`b1`--`b143`)** is
`docs/reference_key_map_full.csv`. Keys `b30`--`b143` consolidate the unique
records from the earlier research registry after DOI/eprint/title
deduplication; the registry itself remains unchanged as an audit trail.

## Audit corrections made on 2026-08-23

- The first pass incorrectly described the 29 currently cited records as the
  complete bibliography. The corrected consolidation retains those stable keys
  and appends all 114 unique research-registry records as `b30`--`b143`.
- Forty arXiv discovery records had their author lists resolved through
  alphaXiv metadata. Twenty-one abbreviated non-arXiv author lists were checked
  against publisher, proceedings, or primary-paper metadata. The canonical
  file now contains no `and others`, unresolved, unverified, or not-read audit
  marker; reading status remains recorded separately in the full CSV map.

- The old `axiv2602_08033_comparisonsandratings` entry had unresolved authors.
  AlphaXiv resolves them as Julien Fageot, Matthias Grossglauser, Lê-Nguyên
  Hoang, Matteo Tacchi-Bénard and Oscar Villemaud; this is now `b17`.
- The old `shihab2025est` entry had stale title/year/author ordering and lacked
  the final venue. The final primary record is Akter, Shihab and Sharma,
  Findings of ACL 2026, pp. 10554–10583, DOI
  `10.18653/v1/2026.findings-acl.513`; this is now `b13`.
- AlphaXiv's exact-title resolver did not locate the Lappas–Filippas IEEE Access
  article and returned SimAB instead. The article was therefore verified via
  DOI `10.1109/ACCESS.2026.3703706` and DBLP, while SimAB is retained separately
  as `b3`.
- `HybridRAG-BN` is added as adjacent, not direct, prior work: it is Bangla
  KBQA with BM25/BGE-M3, Gemma generation and a LoRA-fine-tuned verifier. The
  present thesis generates cinema responses, does not fine-tune an LLM and
  keeps its outcome verifier outside the loop.
